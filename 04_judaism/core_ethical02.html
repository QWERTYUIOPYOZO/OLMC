	    <h1>Content Description </h1>
	    	<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Role of the prophets</div>
			<div class="text">The Prophets of the Tenak were individuals who experienced the call of God to bring 
			a message to their community. They were often reluctant to accept their mandate and many suffered 
			greatly due to the controversial nature of their message.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Justice, equality, peace and freedom</div>
			<div class="text">The Prophets frequently the status quo and confronted authority in their communities. 
			They were often called to proclaim a message arguing that <b>people were straying from the path</b> set down 
			by the <b>Torah</b>.
			<p>They also were frequently called to challenge the apathy of people and to insist that they take a 
			more pro-active stance in reforming social structures to achieve a situation where <b>equality, justice 
			and peace</b> would prevail.</p>
			<p>Thus, the prophetic vision can be characterised as one which challenges the evils and inequalities in 
			the community. This vision criticises the notion of passive acceptance of the world as it is and 
			advocates that all people should work towards a better world, where peace, justice and equality 
			prevail. Thus, the prophetic vision is intimately connected with <b>assisting the plight of the poor, 
			needy and the oppressed</b>. The prophetic tradition stresses the importance of the broad concepts of 
			justice, peace and equality, with a particular emphasis on living a righteous life and argues that 
			these concepts should take precedence over the ritual and sacerdotal elements of ethical observance.</p>
			<p>In reflecting on the prophetic vision a number of key ideas emerge which have significant bearing on 
			the understanding of Jewish ethics.</p></div>
			</div>
		<h2>Tikkun Olam</h2>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Repair and transformation of the world</div>
			<div class="text">Tikkun Olam can be broadly translated from the Hebrew to mean the <b>repair or 
			transformation of the world</b>. In essence tikkun olam is the notion that if one person saves another 
			single human being then it is as though that person has saved the whole world.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Role of the individual in bettering the world</div>
			<div class="text">The notion of tikkun olam in contemporary Jewish society is intimately connected with 
			the concept of social justice. In the prayer known as the "Alenu" Jews are reminded that the primary 
			aim of life is to "perfect the world under the Kingdom of God". Thus, each <b>individual has a responsibility 
			to rectify the inequalities</b> in the world by taking an active stance in helping the poor and needy.
			<p>Even though the idea of tikkun olam is based on recognising the paramount importance of each individual's 
			contribution towards perfecting the world, it also recognises that the process of achieving a just world 
			cannot be completed by an individual alone. Hence the Talmud affirms that "It is not your task to complete 
			the work but you are not free to desist from it" (Avot 2:21).</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Stewardship</div>
			<div class="text">In essence this social justice oriented principle which underpins the ethical precepts of 
			Judaism teaches that human beings are to be the stewards of the earth in caring for the earth and its 
			creatures. Thus, the concept of tikkun olam is an overarching principle that <b>encapsulates the 
			spirit of many mitzvot</b>.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">HaMascheah</div>
			<div class="text">Human beings are put on the earth to be proactive participants in bettering the world. 
			In this way human beings are partners with God. The aim of tikkun olam is to achieve a perfected world, 
			or <b>"haMascheach"</b>. This perfected vision will ultimately reach its fulfillment with the coming of the 
			Messiah who will preside over it.</div>
			</div>
		<h2>Gemilut Chasidim</h2>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Acts of loving kindness</div>
			<div class="text">Gemilut Chasidim means <b>"acts of loving kindness"</b>. Examples of gemilut chasidim include 
			visiting the sick, feeding the poor and comforting the mourner. In essence, the notion of gemilut chasidim, 
			which is the principle that underpins many commandments, contains the basic instruction that 
			"You shall love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18). In Midrashic literature, gemilut 
			chasidim is identified as the characteristic trait that defines the Jewish identity. The Talmud 
			also stresses the importance of this concept, as it explains that the most important pre-condition 
			of being a truly devout individual is having a good heart.</div>
			</div>
		<h2>Tzedakah</h2>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Charity</div>
			<div class="text">Stemming from the notion of gemilut chasidim is a principle known as tzedakah which 
			roughly means <b>charity</b>. Charity, though, does not necessarily mean monetary donations. Tzedakah is seen 
			as part of the process of seeking a just world. All Jews are required to give tzedakah within means 
			which are reasonable for each individual. Hence, an individual must not endanger his or her own life 
			to perform this mitzvah. Tzedakah does not only stress the importance of giving donations but it 
			also highlights the importance of how one gives and hence provides guidelines of what is deemed 
			acceptable when one gives tzedakah. The Talmud for example, cautions , "Do not humiliate a beggar" 
			as "God is beside him".</div>
			</div>
		<h2>Bal Tashkit</h2>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Do not destroy</div>
			<div class="text">Bal Tashkit is a notion that <b>prohibits the unnecessary destruction of God's creation</b> 
			whether it is flora of fauna. This is because gratuitous destruction of creation may mean that another 
			person cannot utilise God's gifts to the world. Although the original meaning of bal tashkit related to 
			destruction in the context of military conflict it has subsequently come to be connected with modern 
			ecological concerns. Bal tashkit prohibits the needless destruction and degradation of the environment, 
			thus it promotes respect and care for the environment, and emphasises the notion of human stewardship 
			for the earth.</div>
