		<h1>Content Description </h1>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Strictness of halakhic observance as the definitive factor </div>
			<div class="text">Before considering the distinguishing characteristics of the major groupings within Judaism it 
			will be helpful to briefly survey the contours of history which gave rise to the existence of different groups 
			in the Jewish tradition. The essential factor that differentiates between the Jewish groupings is how strictly 
			they apply the <b>halakhah</b>, that is, the collective body of Jewish rabbinic law and tradition.</div>
			</div>
		<h2>Progressive Judaism</h2>
		<h3>1) Reform Judaism</h3>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Oral and written law do not represent literal word of God</div>
			<div class="text">Reform Judaism developed in <b>nineteenth century German</b> as a result of the experience of the 
			<b>Haskalah</b>, which is also known as the Jewish Enlightenment. Later in the century Reform Judaism was brought to 
			America by German immigrants. Reform Judaism is characterised by its rejection of the concept of divine 
			revelation as a direct dictation of the Tenak by God. This is the notion that the <b>Written Law</b> is the literal 
			word of God and similarly, that the <b>Oral Law</b> is an extension of this divine revelation. Rather Reform 
			Judaism holds the belief that the <b>Torah was written by divinely inspired human beings</b>. The implication of 
			this core belief is that the Torah is inspirational and instructional, but not binding in a literal sense, 
			since it is not the literal word of God.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Rejection of strict halakhic observance</div>
			<div class="text">This amounted to a movement away from strict of halakhic observance. The halakhah encompasses 
			a broad spectrum of laws regulating dietary requirements, sexual and familial purity. It also formalised the 
			existence of a priestly caste and codes of dress. The reform movement's rejection of halakhic laws was most 
			pronounced in the early years of its development, as seen in the 1885 Pittsburgh Platform, which is the 
			founding document of American Reform Judaism. The rejection of strict halakhic observance, whilst explicit 
			was not absolute, as the ethical commandments set out in the Torah were still considered binding.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Other significant beliefs</div>
			<div class="text">Other notable beliefs of Reform Judaism, which differentiate it from traditional Judaism 
			include its rejection of the notion of a personal <b>Messiah</b>, the resurrection of the dead, the return to the 
			<b>Holy Land</b>, the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, and the reintroduction of Temple sacrifice.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Innovations in ritual practice </div>
			<div class="text">Reform Judaism throughout its history has also made significant reforms in terms of ritual 
			practice. Innovations made by Reform Judaism include introducing religious service in the vernacular of the 
			community instead of Hebrew and men and women sitting together during worship. In more recent times, Reform 
			Judaism has also pioneered and pushed for the ordination of women, the use of the organ in services, the <b>Bat 
			Mitzvah</b> and the confirmation ceremony. Reform Judaism in modern times is also recognised for its active 
			involvement in social justice issues.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Reform Judaism is increasingly diverse in modern times</div>
			<div class="text">Reform Judaism has become increasingly diverse in recent times, and will continue to expand 
			and grow as a pluralistic movement. In fact, there are few definitive norms which all members adhere to. One 
			segment of Reform Judaism is retreating back towards tradition and is beginning to reintegrate some of the 
			halakhic practices originally rejected by the founders of Reform Judaism. Furthermore, since the Holocaust, 
			Reform Judaism despite the rejection of the belief in the return to the Holy Land has been more sympathetic 
			to the Zionist cause.</div>
			</div>
		<h3>2) Reconstructionism</h3>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Oral and written law do not represent the literal word of God</div>
			<div class="text">The Reconstructionist movement was founded by <b>Mordecai Kaplan in the 1920s</b> with the 
			organisational structure of the group being formalised in the 1950s and 1960s. Reconstructionism has a 
			limited number of members because it is largely a movement of intellectuals. Like the Reform and Conservative 
			Judaism, Reconstructionists reject the notion that the Written and Oral Torah was the product of direct 
			dictation from God, but believe that such texts were written by <b>divinely inspired human beings</b>. Hence they do 
			not represent the literal word of God.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Judaism as a religion and civilisation</div>
			<div class="text">Kaplan held the belief that the Torah is "the expression of ancient Israel's attempt to base 
			his life on a declaration of dependence on God, and on a constitution which embodies the laws according to 
			which God expected ancient Israel to live". To sum this up, in essence Reconstructionism is centered on the 
			belief that "the past has a vote, not a veto" in asserting that Judaism is not merely a religion, it is a 
			<b>culture and civilisation</b>.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Zionism</div>
			<div class="text">It is not surprising, therefore, that <b>Zionism</b> features most prominently in Reconstructionist 
			thought. Zionism in essence is about striving towards achieving the establishment of a Jewish state. Zionism is 
			not a strand within Judaism, rather it is a political philosophy which features in the thinking of many Jewish 
			groups.</p>
			<p>Zionist philosophy also influences the way Reconstructionists understand the mitzvot, which literally means 
			commandments. Reconstructionists argue that considering the evolution of Judaism, not all of the original 613 
			commandments will be applicable to our present day society.</p>
			<p>Accordingly, Reconstructionists have devised criteria to determine which mitzvoth are applicable to society 
			today. The first criterion is whether the commandment helps to build up the cultural identity of the Jewish 
			people as a civilisation. The second criterion builds upon the first, as it questions whether the commandment 
			assists in the attainment of personal and group wisdom.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">God as a process</div>
			<div class="text">Reconstructionism is so significantly similar to Conservative Judaism that many have described 
			Reconstructionism as Conservative Judaism minus the belief in a personal God. Reconstructionists believe that 
			God is not a supernatural being rather God is seen as a process or power that is the <b>sum of all forces that 
			gives life meaning and worth</b>.</div>
			</div>
		<h2>Conservative Judaism</h2>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Associations with Reform Judaism</div>
			<div class="text">Conservative Judaism began in <b>Germany in the mid to late nineteenth century</b> as a reaction 
			towards Reform Judaism and its explicit and outright rejection of halakhic practice. Its founder, Zacharias 
			Frankel, initially joined the Reform Movement in rejecting the belief that the Written Law was the literal word 
			of God in favor of the notion that authorship should be attributed to divinely inspired human beings.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Reinterpretation of halakhic law</div>
			<div class="text">Not long after, a group of less radical Reform Jews broke away from Reform Judaism in the 
			belief that they were still bound to follow the ritual law, that is, that they were still <b>bound to follow the 
			halakhah</b>. As a consequence, Conservative Judaism still holds the Oral Law as the authoritative source for 
			halakhah. Conservative Judaism which today constitutes the largest grouping of Jews in the US was brought 
			to America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Comparison with Orthodox Judaism</div>
			<div class="text">The core belief of Conservative Judaism is the belief that the ritual law whilst binding is 
			open to interpretation and it is up to each new generation to make the halakhic law applicable to the age. 
			That is not to suggest that the application of the halakhic laws is purely arbitrary. In fact, Torah study 
			involves a rigorous study of the socio-cultural conditions in which it was written and consequently, how it 
			can be applied to the modern times.</p>
			<p>In this way Conservative Judaism differs from Orthodox Judaism in that whilst both acknowledge the importance 
			of the halakhah in regulating the day to day life of a Jew, Conservative Jews believe that the interpretation 
			of these <b>laws are ever-evolving and capable of being adjusted to contemporary needs</b>. This is based on the 
			understanding that the halakhah itself is a product of the socio-cultural conditions of the time and not set 
			in concrete.</p>
			<p>Thus, Conservative Judaism has joined with the Reform and Reconstructionist groups within Judaism in some of 
			its reforms such as ordaining women as rabbis and cantors.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Other notable features</div>
			<div class="text">Other distinguishing features of Conservative Judaism include the fact that it holds 
			services in the vernacular and includes prayers in the vernacular at other times when most of the service is 
			in Hebrew. Like Reform groups, Conservative synagogues use the organ in services. Conservative Judaism also 
			emphasises the importance of the land of Israel and the continuation of the Jewish tradition.</div>
			</div>
		<h2>Orthodox Judaism</h2>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Strict observance of mitzvot</div>
			<div class="text">Orthodox Judaism is the name given to what has been mainstream Rabbinic Judaism for centuries. 
			Essentially, Orthodox Judaism is characterised by a strict observance of the commandments as they see these 
			commandments or <b>mitzvot as the direct will of God</b>.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Divisions within Orthodox Judaism</div>
			<div class="text">There are two distinct groups within Orthodox Judaism, <b>Ultra-Orthodox Judaism</b> and <b>Modern 
			Orthodox Judaism</b>. Modern Orthodoxy is a strand of Judaism which while maintaining Orthodox requirements seeks to 
			live as part of the modern world. Ultra Orthodox on the other hand, believes that the only way to ensure the 
			survival of the Jewish people and its religion is to impose a strict separation on Jews from participating 
			with secular society.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Ultra Orthodox Judaism</div>
			<div class="text">The position of Ultra Orthodox Judaism has hardened in response to the growing influence held 
			by Reform and Conservative Judaism. The Hasidic Jews (sometimes spelt Chasidic) are usually regarded as an 
			example of Ultra Orthodox Judaism. They are recognisable by their distinctive dress which includes long black 
			coats, round black hats, beards and side locks. 
			<p><b>Hasidism</b> was founded by Bal Shem Tov in the eighteenth century among Jews who lived in ghettos and who were 
			poor and illiterate as a result of centuries of persecution. The Besht, as Bal Shem Tov became known, sought 
			to rejuvenate many of the essential elements of Jewish law by emphasising in his teachings joy, love and awe 
			of God, attachment/devotion <b>(devekut)</b> to God. Since the destruction of the Eastern Jewry in Europe, the US and 
			Israel have become the centres of Hasidic worship.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Modern Orthodox Judaism</div>
			<div class="text">While the ultra Orthodox groups within Judaism seek to keep themselves separate from the 
			influences of the prevailing culture, Modern Orthodox Judaism is <b>immersed in the surrounding culture</b> while at 
			the same time maintaining faithful observance of the Torah.</p>
			<p>Accordingly, among Modern Orthodox communities Jews will be found involved in a range of professions and 
			involved in most aspects of modern community life. Alongside this immersion in modern society the Modern 
			Orthodox Jew <b>seeks to maintain observance of the Torah</b> through carefully attending to the dietary, ritual and 
			ethical requirements of the tradition.</p></div>
