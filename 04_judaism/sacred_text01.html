	    <h1>Content Description</h1>
	    	<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Tenak</div>
			<div class="text">The Hebrew bible, known as the <b>Tenak</b> is made up of three sections, each containing a 
			number of books which are in turn divided into chapters and verses.
			<p>The first section is the <b>Torah</b> which is essentially the books of the Jewish Law. The second section 
			is the <b>Nevi'im</b> which contains the books of the Prophets. The third section is the <b>Ketuvim</b> which contains 
			a collection of other writings loosely described as Wisdom literature. The most well known of the books 
			of the Ketuvim are those of the Psalms and Proverbs.</p>
			<p>The name of the Hebrew bible comes from the first letter of the name of each section. T for Torah, N 
			for Nevi'im and K for Ketuvim. This forms the acronym TNK. Vowels are added to provide for pronunciation 
			and the word Tenak (TeNaK) is formed. The Tenak is often simply referred to as the Bible or sometimes the 
			Hebrew bible.</p>
			<p>It is also a custom at times to use the term "Torah" to refer generally to the whole Hebrew bible. 
			This is because the Torah is the central element of the Hebrew bible and the section which is most highly 
			esteemed and warrants the most study.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Torah - The most important part of the Tenak</div>
			<div class="text">The first section of the Tenak is the Torah. It contains 5 books which are variously 
			known as the books of the law, the books of Moses and the Pentateuch. The Torah is the most important part 
			of the Tenak because it contains the expression of the <b>Covenant</b> between God and the people of Israel and it 
			sets out the <b>law</b> which Jewish people are obliged to follow in order to keep the Covenant.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Covenantal obligations</div>
			<div class="text">The expression of the Covenant is found principally in the book of Genesis, the first book 
			of the Torah. There are, however, various occasions in the other books of the Torah where the people are 
			called upon to renew their commitment to the Covenant. Thus there are a number of eloquent expressions of 
			the Covenant found throughout the books of the Torah such as in Deuteronomy chapters 5 and 6 and especially 
			in the words of the <b>"shema"</b> (Deuteronomy 6:4-9).</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">613 mitzvot</div>
			<div class="text">The books of the Torah also set out the requirements of keeping the Covenant in terms of 
			the <b>613 mitzvot</b> or commandments. These mitzvot, beginning with the 10 Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17) set 
			out all the requirements expected of the people of Israel in order to be faithful to the Covenant. These 
			mitzvot regulate all aspects of Jewish life including religious rituals, interpersonal relationships, 
			ethics etc.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Observance related to 613 mitzvot</div>
			<div class="text">For an observant Jewish person keeping the mitzvot are of fundamental importance. 
			They will <b>study the Torah</b> to understand what is required and faithfully attempt to follow these 
			requirements. All aspects of observance are related to the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. Accordingly 
			it is impossible to overestimate the significance of the Torah for Jewish life.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Nevi'im</div>
			<div class="text">The second element of the Tenak is the Nevi'im. This section contains the <b>writings of 
			the Prophets</b> and is divided into two groups known as the Major Prophets and the Minor Prophets.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Prophetic tradition</div>
			<div class="text">In history, the role of the Prophets was essentially to <b>call Israel to fidelity with the 
			Covenant</b>. Throughout the history of Israel at various times the people fell away from their observance 
			of the Torah and the Prophets were responsible for pointing out this transgression and calling for 
			repentance and a return to Covenant fidelity. Often this call was accompanied by warnings of dire 
			consequences if Israel failed to repent.
			<p>The writings of the Prophets are therefore a constant reminder to Jewish people of the importance of 
			remaining faithful to the Covenant and also of the <b>blessings and curses associated with Covenant fidelity</b> 
			or the lack thereof.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Nevi'im is secondary to the Torah</div>
			<div class="text">The Nevi'im, therefore, plays a supporting role to the Torah. It calls Jewish people to 
			account and reminds them of their obligation to the Covenant.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Ketuvim </div>
			<div class="text">The third section of the Tenak is the Ketuvim or "writings". The Ketuvim is a collection 
			of books which are loosely referred to as <b>Wisdom literature</b>. The most significant parts of the Ketuvim are 
			the books of Psalms and Proverbs. The <b>book of Psalms</b> contains a mix of hymns of praise and lament. 
			They are extremely important for their role in worship and prayer. The <b>Proverbs</b> are collections of 
			short pithy statements expressing practical wisdom. They are not the type of text requiring theological 
			exegesis, rather they are simple, down to earth pronouncements relating to prudent living.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Tenak is of critical importance to Judaism</div>
			<div class="text">Overall the Hebrew bible has a central role in the Jewish religion. Principally this is 
			through the foundational role of the Torah in Jewish life. The other parts of the Tenak are also important 
			but can be seen primarily as supporting the role of the Torah.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Oral Torah</div>
			<div class="text">Another important element of Jewish sacred texts and writings is the area known as <b>Oral 
			Torah</b>. The Oral Torah is essentially the interpretation and <b>application of the Torah to changing 
			circumstances</b> over successive generations. It was inevitable that a written text would reflect the 
			circumstances in which it was written, yet the enduring principles and precepts of the Torah needed to be 
			applied to each new generation. This need brought about the Oral Torah.
			<p>Almost immediately there was need of interpretation of the Torah so that it could be meaningfully applied 
			in each circumstance. This interpretation was the domain of the Jewish authorities who spent countless 
			hours of study and debate considering the most appropriate application of the Torah.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Mishnah</div>
			<div class="text">The decisions of these authorities were originally passed on in oral form and later came 
			to be written down in collections that could be reliably passed on from generation to generation. The most 
			important of these collections was known as the <b>Mishnah</b>. The Mishnah contained expositions and interpretations 
			of legal sections of the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, The Mishnah was finalised in 
			written form around 200 CE.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Gemara</div>
			<div class="text">The next significant collection of the Oral Torah is known as the <b>Gemara</b>. The Gemara is 
			essentially a commentary on the Mishnah with further interpretation and elaboration of important texts. 
			The Gemara was developed between 300 and 500 CE.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Talmud</div>
			<div class="text">The two parts of Oral Torah, Mishnah and Gemara, were finally collected together in the 
			Talmud during the 5th and 6th centuries CE. The word <b>"Talmud"</b> is an Aramaic term which means learning. The 
			Talmud is an enormous volume of important literature for Jewish life. It contains compilations of the law 
			with detailed elucidations from the wisdom of the Rabbis. It also contains history, stories and theological 
			reflection.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Halakhah</div>
			<div class="text">The Talmud essentially contains two types of subject matter. The first is known as <b>Halakhah</b>. 
			This is the legal component of the Talmud. The Halakhah is comprised of the rules and <b>laws</b> for living. 
			The term "Halakhah" means going or walking". For Jewish people, the Halakhah provides the detailed 
			interpretation and application of the 613 Mitzvot of the Torah which enables them to know the appropriate 
			response to situations that arise. In modern times, Jewish legal authorities known as Halakhic lawyers are 
			able to provide expert guidance in understanding the requirements of Halakhah.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Haggadah</div>
			<div class="text">The second type of subject matter in the Talmud is known as Haggadah which means "telling". 
			The <b>Haggadah</b> includes all the stories, narrations, legend etc. While the Haggadah is important in providing 
			wisdom and insight into principles of Jewish life, it does not have the prescriptive force of the legal 
			requirements of Halakhah.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Bavli and Yerushalmi</div>
			<div class="text">For historical reasons the Talmud actually exists in two forms or two versions. A Babylonian 
			version known as <b>"Bavli"</b> was developed between 400 and 700 CE while the Palestinian version known as 
			<b>"Yerushalmi"</b> was developed between 400 and 600 CE.
			<p>Both versions of the Talmud are acknowledged in Jewish communities, however, usually one has a more 
			prominent place in keeping with the historical and cultural heritage of the particular community.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Systematic codification of the Talmud</div>
			<div class="text">While the Talmud is an extremely important source of Jewish sacred texts and writings, 
			it is also a particularly difficult source to use. This is due to the absence of any systematic codification 
			of the material contained in the Talmud. The absence of this codification meant that the Rabbis were required 
			to undertake painstaking study to be familiar with all the teachings of the Talmud on any given matter which 
			may be scattered throughout the vast text.
			<p>The work of <b>Moses Maimonides</b> in the 11th century CE and his development of the <b>Mishneh Torah</b> has greatly 
			assisted in the study and use of the Talmud.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Talmud is secondary to the Torah</div>
			<div class="text">While the Talmud is the focus of much study in Jewish communities, it is important to 
			recognise that the Talmud is always at the service of the Written Torah. The Torah is the primary document 
			of Jewish sacred texts and writings. It is the Torah that expresses the Covenant and provides the Mitzvot 
			for living. The Talmud is its supporter and companion work. The Talmud draws from the Torah and relies 
			on the Torah. It seeks only to make clear the way for Jewish people to live the requirements of the 
			Covenant as conveyed in the Torah.</div>
