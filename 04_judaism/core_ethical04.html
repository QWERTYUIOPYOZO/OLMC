	    <h1>Content Description </h1>
	    	<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Importance of ethical guidance</div>
			<div class="text">It is expected that Jews will give considerable emphasis to the ethical teachings of 
			the tradition with regards to moral issues. The tradition offers extensive guidance on a wide range of 
			issues ranging from bioethics to social welfare. In this way, adherents of Judaism can make informed 
			moral choices according to the principles of the tradition.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Judaism is a practical religion</div>
			<div class="text">Judaism is concerned primarily with the <b>practical day to day observance of the Torah</b>
			rather than the theoretical speculation of its meaning. The halakhic law serves as a vehicle for applying 
			the less specific principles of the Torah. This practical emphasis flows clearly into the ethical domain 
			where choices between good and evil are made.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Halakhic guidance</div>
			<div class="text">While the Torah is the key source of authority, the <b>halakhah with its detailed guidance</b> 
			is frequently used to determine how the principles of the Torah are to be applied. Thus the Talmudic 
			scholars and halakhic lawyers of the Jewish tradition have a central role in providing the day to day 
			guidance on ethical matters.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Ten Commandments and 613 mitzvot</div>
			<div class="text">The fundamental direction of life for adherents of Judaism will be provided through 
			examples such as the Ten Commandments which are then in turn elaborated in the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. 
			These mitzvot are expressed both in positive and negative terms.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Righteousness, purity and justice</div>
			<div class="text">Positive commandments are the "to do" commandments, and the negative commandments are 
			commandments to refrain from doing something. The Ten Commandments contained in Exodus 20:1-17 and 
			Deuteronomy 5:6-21 is the core of Jewish ethics, and it contains the foundational principles underpinning 
			the Christian ethical system. Thus, it follows that Jews are expected to live their lives in accordance 
			with these <b>general principles of righteousness, purity and justice</b>.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Prophetic tradition</div>
			<div class="text">Another form of ethical guidance for Jews is found in the Prophetic tradition where Jews 
			are called to play their part in creating a better world, especially through <b>challenging oppression and 
			injustice</b>.
			<p>The notions of <b>Tikkun Olam, Gemilut Chasidim, Tzedakah</b> and <b>Bal Tashkit</b> are intimately connected with the 
			concept of social justice, and the broad philosophical notions of peace, equality, and justice. The 
			Prophetic tradition stresses the importance of an individual's contribution to the betterment of the 
			world and therefore the importance of living a righteous life characterised by purity and generosity of 
			spirit.</p>
			<p>In the teaching of the Prophets, devotion and piety, based on principles of justice and charity are 
			seen as more spiritually important than adherence to mere ritualistic practice.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Contemporary ethical guidance</div>
			<div class="text">Judaism also provides ethical guidance at a more specific level in relation to current 
			ethical issues. Judaism has approached some of these issues with a progressive platform, and others with 
			a conservative stance. Traditionally, Judaism is known for its conservative approach to the issue of 
			sexual morality. Today, the different strands of Judaism vary greatly in terms of how strictly they 
			keep the traditional halakhic laws in relation to gender and sexual morality.
			<p>Generally speaking, Judaism adopts a <b>conservative approach</b> to issues like sexual morality and bioethics. 
			The dominant topic for contemporary Jewish ethical scholars has become this issue of bioethics.</p>
			<p>By contrast, Judaism has adopted a <b>progressivist platform</b> in relation to other contemporary concerns 
			like international conflict, debt, trade, business ethics and ecological concerns.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Diversity of ethical positions</div>
			<div class="text">Considering the diversity of positions that Judaism holds in relation to the broader 
			community it is very difficult to assess the effect of the Jewish ethical teachings in an overall sense. 
			This situation is further complicated by the fact that the different groups within Judaism sometimes have 
			<b>significantly different opinions on contemporary ethical issues</b>.
			<p>Thus, it can be said that while Jews are clearly influenced by the ethical teachings of the tradition in 
			terms of the broad principles there is a great deal of diversity in the acceptance of ethical teaching 
			on specific contemporary issues.</p></div>
