                                         <h3 align="left"> Explain the distinguishing features of Conservative, Orthodox and Progressive Judaism within the spectrum of the Jewish tradition.</h3>
                                         <p align="left"> Conservative, Orthodox and Progressive groups within Judaism all have distinguishing features as a result of how they formulate and understand the notion of halakhic observance. Considering that Judaism is primarily about ritualistic observance, which is regarded as the key indicator of faith, what differentiates these different groups within Judaism is how strictly they apply the halakhah. The halakhah is the collective body of Jewish rabbinic law and tradition. How strictly the different groups apply halakhah can be traced back to the question of whether they understand these mitzvot or commandments as the direct and unchanging will of God or whether they believe that these halakhic laws are guidelines for the practice of Judaism which are not binding and hence can be reinterpreted in the light of changing circumstances. Orthodox Judaism adopts the former stance, and Conservative and Progressive Judaism which developed in reaction to Orthodox Judaism several centuries later, accept the latter stance to varying degrees.</p>
                                         <p align="left"> The term Progressive Judaism is an umbrella term that encompasses various groups within Judaism that are loosely united by their rejection of the Orthodox view that the Written and Oral Torah are products of a direct dictation of the Torah by God, meaning that they represent the literal word of God. Rather they believe that the Written and Oral Torah is written by divinely inspired human beings. Consequently, since such texts are not the exact words of God, one does not need to regard the halakhic instructions contained in these texts as binding. That is not to say however, that Progressive Jews regard the halakhah as unimportant and easily dismissible. Rather, they believe that whilst such instructions are of critical importance, the fact that they were written by divinely inspired human beings suggests that such texts were products of the society of the time. Hence the instructions contained in these texts need to be reinterpreted in the light of changing circumstances to ensure that they remain applicable to people today.</p>
                                         <p align="left"> One prominent group within Progressive Judaism is Reform Judaism which grew out of the Haskalah or Enlightenment experience in Germany during the nineteenth century. This movement is highly influential in American today. What makes Reform Judaism unique is that it adopts a total rejection of the belief held by Orthodox Judaism that halakhic laws are binding. Thus, they reject the validity of many traditional practices adopted by Orthodox Jews, such as the dietary requirements, sexual and familial purity and the formalised existence of a priestly caste and codes of dress. The only exception to this general rule is that halakhic guidance in relation to ethics is still considered binding. Otherwise the rejection of the traditional belief that halakhic laws is fairly explicit and absolute.</p>
                                         <p align="left"> This strict rejection of halakhic laws finds expression in the 1885 Pittsburgh Platform which is typically considered as the founding document of American Reform Judaism. This belief stems the belief that the Written and Oral Torah were written by divinely inspired human beings, and hence are not the direct products of divine dictation. Thus, the Torah and the halakhah guidelines drawn from the Torah, whilst they are inspirational and instructional, are not binding since it is not the literal word of God.</p>
                                         <p align="left"> Stemming from Reform Judaism's explicit rejection of traditional practices, including ritual practice, it is not surprising to find that Reform Judaism throughout its history has also made considerable innovations to the area of ritual practice. Some of these practices have been later adopted by other groups within Judaism. For example, Reform Judaism advocates the use of the vernacular of the community to deliver religious services rather than using Hebrew. Furthermore, they were the first Judaic group to incorporate the use of the organ in religious services. They were also one of the earliest groups to introduce the notion that men and women should sit together during worship. In more recent times, they have pushed this gender equality platform even further by allowing women to be ordained and by introducing the practice of Bat Mitzvah for girls. Apart from the issue of gender equality, Reform Judaism has in modern times, also been actively involved in other social justice issues.</p>
                                         <p align="left"> Other distinguishing features of Reform Judaism, which differentiate it from Orthodox Judaism include its rejection of the notion of a personal Messiah, the resurrection of the dead, the return to the Holy Land, the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, and the reintroduction of Temple sacrifice.</p>
                                         <p align="left"> Another movement that comes within the umbrella term of Progressive Judaism is the Reconstructionist movement founded by Mordecai Kaplan in the 1920s. The key characteristic that encapsulates Reconstructionist Judaism and hence distinguishes Reconstructionist Judaism from the other groups within Judaism is the fact that it believes as Kaplan would put it, that the Torah is &ldquo;the expression of ancient Israel's attempt to base his life on a declaration of dependence on God, and on a constitution which embodies the laws according to which God expected ancient Israel to live&rdquo;. Basically it asserts the notion that Judaism is not merely a religion but also a culture. Thus, Zionism which is a movement that aims to establish a Jewish state features strongly in Reconstructionist thought.</p>
                                         <p align="left"> Reconstructionist Judaism is considered as a subgroup within Progressive Judaism because it accepts the notion that the Torah is the product of divinely inspired human beings. But the philosophy of Reconstructionist Judaism on the whole is more similar to Conservative Judaism than Reform Judaism. What distinguishes Reconstructionist Judaism from Conservative Judaism is the fact that it rejects the notion of a personal God. Rather Reconstructionists perceive God as an ongoing process that is the sum of all forces which gives life, meaning and worth.</p>
                                         <p align="left"> The two central characteristics which distinguish Conservative Judaism from the other groups in Judaism are the facts that firstly, it accepts the notion that the Torah was the product of divinely inspired human beings, and secondly, that the halakhic laws drawn from the Torah are binding even if they do not represent the literal word of God. This acceptance of the platform of Reform Judaism and yet its adoption of Orthodox views, can be traced back to its beginnings in the late nineteenth century where the group began as a break away from the radicalism of Reform Judaism. But what differentiates Conservative Judaism from Orthodox Judaism is that whilst both groups acknowledge that the halakhah is binding, Conservative Jews believe that the halakhah is ever-evolving, in the sense that the halakhah has the capacity to be reinterpreted in the light of changing circumstances. This involves an intensive study of the socio-economic conditions in which the texts were written. In this way, the halakhah remains applicable to Jews of all generations. Consequently, Conservative Judaism has followed the footsteps of Reconstructionist and Reform Jews in allowing the ordination of women as rabbis and cantors. In terms of ritual practice, Conservative Judaism shares many similarities with Reform Judaism. For example, services are held in the vernacular and services incorporate the use of the organ.</p>
                                         <p align="left"> Orthodox Judaism is the term used to describe what has been mainstream Rabbinic Judaism for centuries. While the other groups of Judaism more or less believe that the halakhah is open to interpretation in the light of changing values, what distinguishes Orthodox Judaism is the belief that the mitzvot are the direct will of God. Hence, Orthodox Judaism is typically associated with the strict observance of halakhic laws.</p>
                                         <p align="left"> Within Orthodox Judaism itself there are varying degrees of halakhic observance, though keeping such mitzvot is of absolute importance to all groups within Orthodox Judaism. Modern-Orthodox Jews seek to maintain halakhic requirements and live as part of the modern world. Ultra-Orthodox Jews take a different attitude to this issue. What makes them clearly identifiable is their insistence upon a strict separation between religious observance and the secular society. In fact, they attempt to shield Jews from participation with modern society altogether. Hasidic Jews are an example of Ultra-Orthodox Jews who are easily recognisable by their insistence on a separation from secular society, as reflected in distinctive dress, that is, the black hat, the beards, the sidelocks and the long black coats. Hasidism grew out of the ghetto experience in Eastern Europe in the eighteenth century.</p>
                                         <p align="left"> While the ultra Orthodox groups within Judaism seek to keep themselves separate from the influences of the prevailing culture, Modern Orthodox Judaism is immersed in the surrounding culture while at the same time maintaining faithful observance of the Torah.</p>
                                         <p align="left"> Accordingly, among Modern Orthodox communities Jews will be found involved in a range of professions and involved in most aspects of modern community life. Alongside this immersion in modern society the Modern Orthodox Jew seeks to maintain observance of the Torah through carefully attending to the dietary, ritual and ethical requirements of the tradition.</p>
                                         In conclusion, what distinguishes the different groups within Judaism is how strictly they apply the halakhah. The characteristic that identifies Progressive Jews is their rejection of the binding nature of the halakhic laws. This stems from their belief that the Torah is not the product of Divine Revelation, but rather is written by divinely inspired human beings, and hence cannot be considered as binding. This belief is also a foundational principle for Reconstructionist Judaism. But what makes Reconstructionist Judaism unique is the belief that Judaism is both a religion and a civilisation. The mid-way between Progressive and Orthodox Judaism is Conservative Judaism. Conservative Judaism is characterised by its intermediary stance between Progressive Judaism and Orthodox Judaism in accepting both the binding nature of the halakhic laws and the belief that such laws are not the direct product of Divine Revelation. Orthodox Judaism is built on the premise that the mitzvot are the direct will of God and hence need to be strictly followed.

	    <h3 align="left"> Describe the Covenant with the Patriarchs and asses its importance for the beliefs and practices of Judaism.</h3>
	    <p align="left"><b> Introduction (181 words)</b></p>
	    <p align="left"> The Covenant with the Patriarchs, that is, Abraham his son Isaac and grandson Jacob lies at the heart of the beliefs and practices of Judaism. Underpinning the beliefs and practices of Judaism is this relationship between God and the people of Israel that is encapsulated in the Covenant. Essentially, this covenantal relationship is important for practices within Judaism because the people of Israel are required to live according to the laws laid down by God. In return the Jews are blessed with the promises of God's protection. Thus, keeping the mitzvot is central to Judaism as it is the primary measure of fidelity to the Covenant.</p>
	    <p align="left"> There are two key themes in relation to the covenant which makes the Covenant with the Patriarchs significant. Firstly, God promised that Abraham's descends would be as numerous as the stars and would one day become a great nation. Secondly, the Covenant with the Patriarchs established the notion of a promised land. These two concepts lie at the core of Jewish belief and practice which is centered on the idea of fidelity to the Covenant.</p>
	    <p align="left"><b> Section 1 (250 words)</b></p>
	    <p align="left"> Outline the 3 major stages of Abraham's encounter with God and how this leads to the formation of the Covenant. Stress the significance of these events in relation to the beliefs and practices of Judaism by drawing attention to the importance of the actual promises made by God. For example, the encounter recorded in Chapter 15 of Genesis is significant because here God promises that Abraham's descendents will be as numerous as the stars. </p>
	    <p align="left"><b> Section 2 (250 words)</b></p>
	    <p align="left"> Analyse the importance of these key encounters by extracting from these events the major theme or promise that is contained in this Covenant. Basically, emphasise the significance of the promise that Abraham's descendants will be as numerous as the stars together with the concept of the promised land. These two key concepts is the foundation of Jewish beliefs and practices. Make this link explicit by showing how the importance of the Covenant is related to the idea that keeping the mitzvot of the Torah is the fundamental measure of fidelity to the Covenant. Evaluate the importance of the Covenant with Abraham in terms of the implications of this Covenant for the history of the Jewish people, and in particular the concept of blessings associated with fidelity to the Covenant and the painful consequences that come as a result infidelity.</p>
	    <p align="left"><b> Section 3 (250 words)</b></p>
	    <p align="left"> Describe the Covenant between God, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Evaluate the importance of the Covenant by stressing how the notion of nationhood, land and fidelity to the Covenant are central themes that run throughout Jewish history, and hence underpin the practices and beliefs of Judaism. The requirement of fidelity to the Covenant was originally expressed in simple terms such as the call of Abraham to &ldquo;walk in the presence of God and be blameless&rdquo; (Genesis 17:1). Evaluate the extent to which the Covenant is important by briefly mentioning the fact that the Covenant made with the Patriarchs was to be later reaffirmed in the foundational moment of Jewish history, with Moses following the Exodus.</p>
	    <p align="left"><b> Conclusion (152 words)</b></p>
	    The Covenant with the Patriarchs marks the beginning of the Jewish people, founded on an intimate relationship between God and the people of Israel. Thus, because the Covenant with the Patriarchs lies at the heart of the Jewish religion, it is infinitely important to the beliefs and practices of Judaism. This is evident because keeping the mitzvot, which is the central concern of Judaic practices, is seen as the primary indicator of fidelity to the Covenant. The contours of Jewish history reveal that people are rewarded when they are faithful and suffer consequences when they are unfaithful. The major themes which run throughout the practices of Judaism are fidelity, land, kingdom and nationhood. These concepts are derived from the covenantal relationship between God and the Patriarchs. Hence, the ovenant with the Patriarchs is of immense importance for the beliefs and practices of Judaism as the Covenant is the cornerstone of the Jewish religion.<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
