	    <h1>Specimen Questions</h1>
	    <p><b>Explain the role of the Commandments of the Torah in expressing the principal ethical teachings of Judaism.</b></p>
	    <p><b>Explain the role of the Prophets and the Proverbs in providing ethical guidance in Judaism.</b></p>
	    <h2>Sample Responses</h2>
	    <p> <b>Explain the role of the Commandments of the Torah in expressing the principal ethical teachings of Judaism.</b></p>
	    <p> The ethical teaching of Judaism has the Torah as its fundamental source and key element. While the Torah may not contain the specificity needed to answer all ethical questions, it does provide the overarching principles that can be applied to new situations and changing circumstances.</p>
	    <p> In seeking to follow ethical guidance, Jews look primarily to the Torah, however, in order to understand the application of the Written Torah they need to have recourse to other sources of guidance from the Oral Torah. Chief among these other sources is the Talmud.</p>
	    <p> While the Talmud is frequently used to guide people's actions, it is always regarded as a companion to the Torah and its guidance must always be seen to be in harmony with the principles of the Torah.</p>
	    <p> The fundamental source of ethical guidance for Jews is the Torah which includes the Written and Oral Torah. Different components of the Torah give ethical guidance to varying degrees of specificity. The 613 mitzvot provide the broadest application of Jewish ethical principles. They are regarded as the foundational elements of Jewish ethics and underpin all other elements.</p>
	    <p> The 613 mitzvot can be further divided into two categories, positive mitzvot and negative mitzvot. Positive mitzvot are commands to perform an act, for example to love one's neighbour while negative mitzvot contain prohibitions such as not killing another.</p>
	    <p> The Ten Commandments are a foundational part of the Jewish ethical system which can be separated into two groups. The first five commandments deal with the relationship between God and the people of Israel. These commandments are formulated as positive, affirmative commandments. The next five commandments are concerned with the relationship between individuals and their community.</p>
	    <p> With the inevitable change over time came the need to reflect on the meaning of the commandments in order that they be meaningfully observed in changing circumstances. Thus the Rabbis have undertaken study in order to consider how the requirements of Torah are to be applied. These precepts must be considered and applied in the light of technological, economic, scientific and sociological changes to ensure that they are observed in an appropriate manner by each new generation of followers.</p>
	    <p> The Rabbinic study and discussion of the meaning and application of the principles of the Torah gave rise to the Oral Torah which now forms an integral part of Jewish life.</p>
	    <p> At the heart of Jewish observance and ethical conduct is the relationship with God known as the Covenant. It is through this Covenant that the people of Israel were protected, sustained and nurtured. From the principles of this Covenant the people of Israel learnt their responsibilities towards their God and towards other people. Thus the 613 mitzvot of the Torah are the fundamental guide of appropriate ethical conduct.</p>
	    <p> From the principles of the Torah a number of concepts have been drawn and elaborated. These provide the key elements of Jewish ethical teaching. These key elements are Tikkun Olam, Gemilut Chasidim, Tzedakah and Bal Tashkit. Each of these ideas finds its origins in the Written Torah and has been elaborated and applied to changing circumstances in the light of Rabbinic study. Therefore they provide a clear link between the commandments of the Torah and the ethical teaching of Judaism.</p>
	    <p> The first of these principles is known as Tikkun Olam which can be broadly translated as the repair or transformation of the world. In essence tikkun olam is the notion that if one person saves another single human being then it is as though that person has saved the entire world.</p>
	    <p> The notion of tikkun olam is closely related to the area of social justice. In the prayer known as the "Alenu" Jews are reminded that the primary aim of life is to "perfect the world under the Kingdom of God". Thus, each individual has a responsibility to rectify the inequalities in the world by taking an active stance in helping the poor and needy.</p>
	    <p> Even though the idea of tikkun olam is based on recognising the importance of each individual's contribution towards perfecting the world, it also recognises that the process of achieving a just world cannot be completed by an individual alone. This element is expressed in the Talmud "It is not your task to complete the work but you are not free to desist from it" (Avot 2:21).</p>
	    <p> In essence this social justice oriented principle which underpins the ethical precepts of Judaism teaches that human beings are to be the stewards of the earth in caring for the earth and its creatures. Thus, the concept of tikkun olam is an overarching principle that encapsulates the spirit of many mitzvot from the Torah.</p>
	    <p> The second principle is Gemilut Chasidim which means "acts of loving kindness". Examples of gemilut chasidim include visiting the sick, feeding the poor and comforting the mourner. In essence, the notion of gemilut chasidim, which is the principle that underpins many commandments, contains the basic instruction that "You shall love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18).</p>
	    <p> In Midrashic literature, gemilut chasidim is identified as the characteristic trait that defines the Jewish identity. The Talmud also stresses the importance of this concept as it explains that the most important pre-condition of being a truly devout individual is having a good heart.</p>
	    <p> Stemming from the notion of gemilut chasidim is the third principle known as tzedakah which roughly means charity. Charity, though, does not necessarily mean monetary donations. Tzedakah is seen as part of the process of seeking a just world. All Jews are required to give tzedakah within means which are reasonable for each individual. Hence, an individual must not endanger his or her own life to perform this mitzvah.</p>
	    <p> Tzedakah does not only stress the importance of giving donations but it also highlights the importance of how one gives and hence provides guidelines of what is deemed acceptable when one gives tzedakah. The Talmud for example, cautions , "Do not humiliate a beggar" as "God is beside him".</p>
	    <p> The fourth principle is known as Bal Tashkit which is a notion that prohibits the unnecessary destruction of God's creation whether it is flora of fauna. This is because gratuitous destruction of creation may mean that another person cannot utilise God's gifts to the world.</p>
	    <p> Although the original meaning of bal tashkit related to destruction in the context of military conflict it has subsequently come to be connected with modern ecological concerns. Bal tashkit prohibits the needless destruction and degradation of the environment, thus it promotes respect and care for the environment, and emphasises the notion of human stewardship for the earth.</p>
	    <p>Therefore it can be seen that while the Torah sometimes lacks the specificity to address all the requirements of ethical living it does, nonetheless provide a clear foundation for ethical teaching in Judaism. The commandments of the Torah remain the fundamental source of Jewish ethical teaching. All principles of Jewish ethics are related back to the commandments of the Torah and all other sources such as the Talmud provide guidance which draws from and is harmony with the Written Torah.</p>
	    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	    <p><b>Explain the role of the Prophets and the Proverbs in providing ethical guidance in Judaism.</b></p>
	    <p><b>Introduction (127 words)</b></p>
	    <p> The Prophetic tradition and the Book of Proverbs provide important ethical principles which encapsulate and underpin the halakhic laws that guide Jews in relation to moral decision making. The Prophets and the Proverbs expand on the ethical principles outlined in the Torah in relation to the philosophical concepts of righteousness, justice, equality and peace.</p>
	    <p> The Prophets were individuals who were called by God to proclaim the message that people were straying from the path set down by the Torah. Their vision which encompasses the notions of Tikkun Olam, Gemilut Chasidim, Tzedakah and Bal Tashkit is intimately tied with notions of social justice. The Book of Proverbs is an important part of Wisdom Literature and extols moral living, righteousness, purity, generosity of spirit and wisdom in a collection of pithy statements offering practical ethical guidance.</p>
	    <p><b>Section 1 (150 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Describe what the Prophetic tradition is, and what the critical message extolled by the Prophets was. Highlight the relationship between this prophetic message and the way in which this message underpins the themes of equality, justice and peace contained in the Torah as a way of explaining the role of the prophetic tradition.</p>
	    <p><b>Section 2 (150 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Briefly outline the principles of Tikkun Olam. Give reasons for why this principle is significant by noting that the implication of this principle is that they emphasize the importance of the individual's contribution to bettering the world. This overarching principle encapsulate the spirit of many mitzvot contained in the Torah in providing ethical guidance in Judaism.</p>
	    <p><b>Section 3 (150 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Explain what Gemilut Chasidim means. Show how this principle provides ethical guidance in Judaism by drawing out the implications of this belief and its link to the principle that you shall love your neighbour as yourself etc. Relate this to the concept of tzedakah and how this notion of charity provides practical guidance in relation to ethics.</p>
	    <p><b>Section 4 (150 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Describe the concept of Bal Tashkit and explain the significance of this concept in relation to modern ecological concerns and how that provides ethical guidance for Jews. Link this to the notion of stewardship described in the Torah.</p>
	    <p><b>Section 5 (150 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Briefly describe the content of the Book of Proverbs and the nature of the ethical advice the Book of Proverbs provides. Explain how the Book of Proverbs stresses the broad principles of righteousness, generosity of spirit, and purity over a strict ritualistic observance of the law.</p>
	    <p><b>Section 6 (100 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Analyse the different nuances of the notion of wisdom as a path to God, wisdom as being derived from God and wisdom as powerful and positive force. Show how this concept of prudent living underpins the specific halakhic laws.</p>
	    <p><b>Section 7 (100 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Describe the concepts of integrity and righteousness with reference to biblical passages. The significance of this notion is that an upright person who follows the halakhic laws in an honest fashion will be rewarded, and vice versa.</p>
	    <p><b>Section 8 (200 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Analyse the interrelated concepts of generosity of spirit and purity by showing the relationship between the Covenantal notions of freedom from oppression and slavery and the theme of assisting those in need.</p>
	    <p><b>Conclusion (115 words)</b></p>
	    <p> In conclusion, the Prophetic tradition and the Proverbs provide ethical guidance in Judaism by elucidating the general underlying principles within the halakhic laws. The notions of tikkun olam, gemilut chasidim, tzedakah, bal tashkit, wisdom, purity generosity of spirit are intimately connected with the broad social justice notions of justice, righteousness, equality and peace.</p>
	    These overarching principles contained in the Prophets and the Book of Proverbs build on, and contextualise the halakhic laws relating to ritual observance contained in the Talmud. These general principles ultimately stem from the covenantal relationship where the Jews were nurtured, sustained and protected. It was this relationship which taught the Jews how to treat others in relation to moral decision making.<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
