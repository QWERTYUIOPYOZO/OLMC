	    <h1>Content Description </h1>
		<p>The following areas are identified as principal beliefs of Judaism:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li> The oneness of God</li>
		  <li>The eternal nature of God</li>
		  <li>The omnipresence of God</li>
		  <li>The omnipotence of God</li>
		  <li>The essentially spiritual nature of God</li>
		  <li>The divinely inspired moral law</li>
		  <li>The Covenant</li>
	    </ul>
		<p>For each of these principal beliefs two extracts from the Tenak will be examined.</p>
		<p>Given the closeness between the Torah and the beliefs and practices of Judaism it is to be expected that the principal beliefs of Judaism are drawn from expressions in the Torah.</p>
		<h2>God is One</h2>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Shema - Deuteronomy 6:4-9</div>
			<div class="text">Deuteronomy 6:4-9. The first verse of this passage is one of the most important for 
			Judaism. It is known as the shema, taken from the Hebrew word for "hear". It begins with the imperative 
			"hear O Israel the Lord our God, the Lord is one".
			<p>The passage occurs in the context of a renewal of fidelity to the Covenant. Moses has just concluded 
			reiterating the principles of the Covenant and concludes with a statement affirming the oneness of God 
			and directing the people of Israel to keep this in mind and to teach it to their descendents for all time.</p>
			<p>It is an emphatic reminder of the centrality of the notion of the <b>monotheism</b> of Judaism. There is to be 
			no doubt or confusion concerning the oneness of God. In this way the shema is a declaration of faith as well 
			as a guarantee against any idolatry among the people of Israel.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Psalm 83:18 </div>
			<div class="text">The centrality of Judaism's monotheism is also affirmed
			  at various times in the book of Psalms. Once such example is found
			  in Psalm 83:18 where the Psalmist proclaims that "you alone are the Lord,
			   the most high over all the earth". This verse comes at the end of a Psalm
			praying for protection in the face  of a hostile enemy.
			   <p>Frequently in the Psalms there is a prayer asking for God's protection in the face of a hostile threat as 
			found here in Psalm 83. Commonly the Psalm includes a statement which affirms the <b>power of God in the face of 
			threats of idols</b>. In this case the statement clearly affirms the belief in one God "you alone are the Lord, 
		  the most high over all the earth" (Psalm 83:19).</p></div>
		</div>
		<h2>God is Eternal</h2>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">God as creator - Isaiah 45:12</div>
			<div class="text">The belief in the eternal nature of God is expressed both in terms of <b>God's role as 
			creator</b> and also in God's actions through to the end of time. In the book of the prophet Isaiah there is a 
			clear statement of the belief in God as creator. "It was I who made the earth and created mankind upon it. 
			It was my hands that stretched out the heavens; I gave the order to all their host" (Isaiah 45:12).
			<p>This passage affirms the role of God as creator, not only of the earth and humankind but also of the 
			entire cosmos. The passage is part of a section of Isaiah reminding the Jewish people of the fidelity and 
			power of God despite their situation as exiles in Babylon.</p>
			<p>It is significant that this passage reminds the Jewish people of the eternal character of God during a 
			time when they were suffering in exile. It is an example an important element in Jewish belief which 
			refuses to let go of a belief in the <b>everlasting goodness of God</b> despite the worst of circumstances.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Eternal character of God - Psalm 146:10</div>
			<div class="text">The second element of the belief in the <b>eternal character of God</b> is expressed in 
			Psalm 146 expressing trust in God. The Psalm speaks of the virtues of trusting in God before concluding 
			with the statement "the Lord shall reign forever; your God, O Zion, through all generations" (Psalm 146:10).
			<p>In this statement the Psalmist expresses the belief that God's reign is eternal, which, coupled with the 
			belief in the role of God as creator provides a clear expression of the Jewish belief in the eternal character 
			of God.</p></div>
		</div>
		<h2>God is Omnipresent</h2>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">God as an ever-present companion - Psalm 139:4</div>
			<div class="text">Psalm 139 conveys the idea that God is <b>ever present and all knowing</b>. Throughout its twenty 
			four verses the Psalm explores various ways of acknowledging God's presence and omniscience "even before a 
			word is on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know the whole of it." (Psalm 139:4). God is portrayed as an ever 
			present companion who knows every element and every aspect of the Psalmist's life. </div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">God pervades all aspects of life - Psalm 139:17</div>
			<div class="text">Not only does the Psalm speak of God's omnipresence and omniscience, it also conveys the 
			idea of God's design pervading the life of the Psalmist. On this point, verse 17 proclaims "How weighty 
			are your designs, O God, how vast the sum of them.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Exodus 3:4-10</div>
			<div class="text">A second element of the belief in God's omnipresence is found in the account of the call of 
			Moses (Exodus 3:4-10). This passage details the encounter between God and Moses at Horeb where Moses witnesses 
			the phenomena of the burning bush. It forms part of a longer passage where Moses is called by God to liberate 
			the Hebrew people living in captivity in Egypt.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">God witnesses the oppressive treatment of the Hebrews - Exodus 3:7</div>
			<div class="text">In the course of God addressing Moses the text expresses the idea that God has witnessed 
			the treatment of the Hebrew people at the hands of the Egyptians (Exodus 3:7). This is particularly important 
			as it highlights the presence of God with the Hebrew people even during their most desperate times during the 
			captivity in Egypt.
			<p>In other words, the passage affirms the <b>presence of God even in the worst of times</b>. Such an understanding 
			is of critical importance to the Jewish people. This is evident in times of trauma such as the Babylonan 
			exile (587-537 BCE), the destruction of the second temple by the Romans (70CE) and more recently the horrors 
			of the holocaust during World War II.</p></div>
		</div>
		<h2>God is all powerful</h2>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Song of Moses - Exodus 15:1-18 </div>
			<div class="text">The expression of the omnipotence of God is found frequently in the Tenak. One example is in 
			the ancient text known as the song of Moses. This passage is found in Exodus 15:1-18.
			<p>The passage is set in the moments immediately following the miraculous parting of the Red Sea. God had 
			parted the sea to allow the Hebrews to cross before allowing the sea to flow back in its place trapping 
			and destroying the Egyptian armies that were pursuing the Hebrews.</p>
			<p>The <b>ability to manipulate nature is a classic sign of power</b> and the witness of this event was a confirmation 
			for the Hebrew people of the awesome power of God.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Exodus 15:6 and Exodus 15:8</div>
			<div class="text">The text that follows the crossing of the Red Sea includes a number of references to the 
			power of God. "Your right hand, O Lord, magnificent in power, your right hand, O Lord, has shattered the 
			enemy" (Exodus 15:6) and "At a breath of your anger the waters piled up the flowing waters stood like a 
			mound, the flood waters congealed in the midst of the sea" (Exodus 15:8).</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Creation - Genesis 1:1-2:7</div>
			<div class="text">A further example of the belief in the omnipotence of God is found in the stories of 
			creation (Genesis 1:1-2:7). To bring creation into being is unmistakable evidence of remarkable power.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">"Let there be light" - Genesis 1:3</div>
			<div class="text">The first of the two creation stories bears witness to the creative power of God by 
			portraying creation coming into being at the word of God. "Then God said, "let there be light" and there 
			was light" (Genesis 1:3). The power of God is so great and limitless that simply uttering the word will 
			bring creation into being. </div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Breath of life - Genesis 2:7</div>
			<div class="text">In the second creation story the author employs anthropomorphisms to convey the idea of the 
			creative actions of God. God takes the clay from the ground from it fashions the human beings (Genesis 2:7). 
			This in itself is an act of enormous power, however, the critical witness to God's power is in the final 
			part of verse 7 where God breathes the breath of life into the nostrils of the man "and so man became a 
			living being" (Genesis 2:7).
			<p>The significance of this part of the passage is the link between the breath of God and the life of the 
			human being. <b>God's breath is the life giving force</b> which brings the human being into life.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Breath of life - Genesis 2:7</div>
			<div class="text">In the second creation story the author employs anthropomorphisms to convey the idea of the 
			creative actions of God. God takes the clay from the ground from it fashions the human beings (Genesis 2:7). 
			This in itself is an act of enormous power, however, the critical witness to God's power is in the final

			human being. <b>God's breath is the life giving force</b> which brings the human being into life.</p></div>
		</div>
		<h2>God is pure spirit</h2>
		<p>While Judaism holds an emphatic belief that God is pure spirit and therefore has no physical form, it nevertheless 
		depicts God variously in anthropomorphic ways such as the second creation story (Genesis 2:4-7) which describes 
		God as forming human beings out of clay and breathing life into their nostrils (Genesis 2:7).</p>
		<p>While these anthropomorphisms are common it is clear that they are not to be interpreted in a literal sense. 
		To do so would be to undermine the principal belief that God is pure spirit and has no physical form. Passages such 
		as the example from Genesis noted above are clearly to be regarded as symbolic or figurative statements expressing the 
		activity of God.</p>
		<p>The belief that God is pure spirit is not stated explicitly in texts from the Tenak. Rather it is understood 
		implicitly through reflecting on the meaning of some key texts.</p>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Creation stories - Genesis 1:1-2:4</div>
			<div class="text">The first of these texts is the first of the creation stories (Genesis 1:1-2:4). 
			The beginning of the story conveys an image of a time before creation where God dwelt over a formless void. 
			The story of creation follows where God sequentially brings into being the array of the cosmos.
			<p>Prior to the first act of creation there is nothing but God in a formless void. In this period before the 
			first act of creation there is no form and yet God exists. This account of the beginning of creation attests 
			to the existence of God without form and provides an initial basis for the belief that God is pure spirit.</p>
			<p>The second passage which helps to express the idea of God as pure spirit is in the account of the giving of 
			the 10 commandments (Exodus 20:1-17). The commandments are given following God's intervention to free the 
			Hebrew people from captivity in Egypt. They are the beginning of the Torah, the life giving law by which 
			the people of Israel are to live.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Ten commandments Exodus 20:4</div>
			<div class="text">In this passage the fourth verse gives the commandment prohibiting the carving of 
			images "you shall not carve idols for yourself in the shape of anything in the sky above or on the earth 
			below or in the waters beneath the earth" (Exodus 20:4).</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Prohibition on the carving of images - Exodus 20:4</div>
			<div class="text">The primary focus of this prohibition is to prevent the people of Israel from abandoning 
			their monotheistic beliefs and adopting the beliefs in other gods prevalent in the region. Additionally it 
			emphasises that images of any created thing cannot be used to represent God.
			<p>Thus, through the prohibition of carving representations of created things, the commandments give witness 
			not only to the <b>oneness of God</b> but also to the fact that <b>God does not have any form</b> and therefore cannot 
			be represented. Any attempt at a representation of God is false and thus regarded as idolatry.</p></div>
		</div>
		<h2>The moral law</h2>
		<p>There is a clear understanding in the Jewish tradition that God has set down a way of living which is life 
		giving and sustaining. It is clear and unequivocal in its requirements. This is the moral law set down in the 
		Torah which expresses the Covenant.</p>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Moral requirements are clear - Deuteronomy 30:11-20</div>
			<div class="text">One passage where this moral law is expressed is in the words of Moses shortly before 
			his death and the crossing into the promised land (Deuteronomy 30:11-20). In this passage Moses emphasises 
			that the <b>requirements of living are clear and unmistakable</b> "it is something very near to you, already in 
			your mouths and in your hearts; you only have to carry it out" (Deuteronomy 30:14).</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Life giving character of the law - Deuteronomy 30:19-20</div>
			<div class="text">The same passage indicates the <b>life giving character of the law</b> "choose life, then, 
			that you and your descendents may live, by loving the Lord, your God, heeding his voice and holding fast 
			to him" (Deuteronomy 30:19-20).
			<p>The people of Israel are taught that to live by the requirements of God's law is a live giving choice. 
			To disregard the law is to put their lives in jeopardy.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">The Prophetic tradition</div>
			<div class="text">The emphasis on the moral law is also clearly and strongly expressed in the Nevi'im. The 
			tradition of the Prophets is seen as constantly reminding Israel of its obligations to faithfully follow the 
			law and warning of dire consequences should they fail to do so. In the traditions of the Prophets there is a 
			strong emphasis on moral action reflecting justice towards one another. One of the many examples 
			reflecting this requirement is found in the book of Isaiah chapter 10.
			<p>This part of the book contains various warnings against Israel concerning failings to keep the requirement 
			of the law and relating the coming disaster which was to be the destruction of the temple in 587 BCE and 
			the fifty year exile in Babylon.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Failure to live justly and care for society's most vulnerable - Isaiah 10:1-2</div>
			<div class="text">At the beginning of chapter 10 there is a section which focuses on the failure to live 
			justly with one another and in particular the failure to <b>care for the most vulnerable members of society</b> 
			(Isaiah 10:1-2). The passage condemns the actions of those who create unjust laws and allow situations of 
			oppression to exist (Isaiah 10:1).
			<p>It also identifies the failing of the community to care for its most vulnerable. "depriving the needy of 
			judgment and robbing my people's poor of their rights. Making widows their plunder and orphans their 
			prey" (Isaiah 10:2).</p>
			<p>In societies such as at the time of Isaiah, widows and orphans were the most vulnerable in society with no 
			provisions for their care. It required, therefore, a sense of justice in the community to ensure that such 
			people were provided for.</p>
			<p>In keeping with this need the moral law of Judaism has a strong emphasis on providing for the needs of 
			the most vulnerable in the community.</p></div>
		</div>
		<h2>The Covenant</h2>
		<p>The belief in the Covenant is fundamental for understanding Judaism as it underpins all beliefs regarding 
		the expectations of Jewish life. The requirements of the Covenant are expressed at various stages through the 
		texts in the Tenak.</p>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Land and descendants Genesis 17:4 & 17:8</div>
			<div class="text">Genesis chapter 17 contains the tradition of the Covenant with Abraham. In verse 4, 
			God promises that Abraham will become "the <b>father of a host of nations</b>" (Genesis 17:4). The Covenant also 
			includes the promise of land; "I will give to you and to your descendents after you the land in which you 
			are now staying, the whole land of <b>Canaan</b> as a permanent possession" (Genesis 17:8).
			<p>In these extracts from the passage the important promises of descendents and the land are clearly seen. 
			For the Covenant with Abraham, these are the two central planks of the promise. That of an enduring 
		  progeny and of a promised land.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Covenant obligations:<br>
			- Be blameless Genesis 17:1<br>
			- Circumcision Genesis 17:12</div>
			<div class="text">The passage also sets out requirements of Abraham and his descendents in response to the 
			Covenant. The first is that Abraham is required to <b>walk in the presence of God</b> and be blameless (Genesis 17:1). 
			The second is that <b>circumcision</b> is to be the sign of the Covenant between God and the people of Israel 
			(Genesis 17:12).</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Ten Commandments  Exodus 20:1-17</div>
			<div class="text">The Covenant in terms of ritual and moral requirements is then expressed in the giving of 
			the Torah to Moses at Sinai (Exodus 19-20). The requirements of the Covenant govern and <b>regulate all 
			aspects of Jewish life</b>. From the principles set down in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17) and 
			through all the remaining mitzvot of the Torah, which are expressed in text that follows, Jews are 
			guided and directed precisely into keeping the requirements of the Covenant.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">613 mitzvot </div>
			<div class="text">Including the Ten Commandments there are a total of 613 mitzvot expressed in the Torah. 
			These are then supported in terms of explanation and application by the vast text of the Oral Torah to 
			provide a clear and precise explanation of the requirements of keeping the Covenant.</div>
