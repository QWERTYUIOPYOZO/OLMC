	    <h1>Content Description </h1>
	    	<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Importance of the Covenant</div>
			<div class="text">The <b>Covenant</b>, which lies at the heart of the Jewish religion, is a series of agreements 
			recorded in the <b>Hebrew Bible</b> between God and the people of Israel. The importance of the Covenant cannot 
			be overestimated because the Covenant, which is the <b>cornerstone of Judaism</b>, is the living expression of 
			the relationship between God and the people of Israel.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Pattern of covenants</div>
			<div class="text">The expressions of the Covenant in the <b>Tenak</b> essentially follow the same pattern. They 
			begin by describing or recalling God's great acts in the events of the everyday lives of the people. 
			Next they contain commands for the people to follow. Finally, they conclude with a list of blessings and 
			curses.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Noah - God's saving actions</div>
			<div class="text">There are four main expressions of the Covenant made between God and the people of Israel. 
			The first expression is the Covenant made between God and Noah. God saves Noah and his family from the flood 
			and in return Noah is obliged to live by caring for the earth, humankind, and all of creation.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Noah's covenantal obligations</div>
			<div class="text">In essence, Noah and his family are called to live in God's image and to walk in God's 
			path. God warns Noah that if harmful acts are committed than God will exact vengeance for these acts. 
			However, God also promises that if Noah is faithful to his covenantal obligations, than a disaster like 
			the flood will not happen again. A rainbow appeared as a sign of this pact and the tradition teaches that 
			the rainbow appearing in the sky is a sign of God remembering the Covenant.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Abraham - God's promise</div>
			<div class="text">The second expression of the Covenant recorded in the Hebrew Bible was between God and 
			Abraham. Abraham is the first of the three <b>Patriarchs</b> of Judaism. Abraham (Abram) is called to leave his 
			home and move to the land promised by God. The event is highly significant because it marks an agreement 
			between Abraham and God which introduces two significant elements of the Covenant. These are the <b>promises 
			of land and of descendents</b>.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Descendants</div>
			<div class="text">God promises that Abraham's descendants will be as numerous the "stars of the heavens and 
			the grains of sand on the seashore" and Abraham, in return is called to be faithful to God and to walk in 
			God's ways.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Canaan and Abraham's covenantal obligations</div>
			<div class="text">God also promises that Abraham will be the head of a great nation, and that his people 
			will be given a land of their own, the land of Canaan, later known as Israel which is the modern day State 
			of Israel and Palestinian Territories. In order to receive these blessings, like Noah, Abraham was obliged 
			to walk in God's way, that is, to live in a righteous and just way. This spiritual covenant was sealed 
			with a visible sign, that is, circumcision or <b>brit milah</b>. This physical sign of the covenant has been 
			renewed by males in each generation.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Exodus event</div>
			<div class="text">The third expression of the Covenant relates to the agreement made between Moses, the 
			People of Israel and God. This Covenant is the foundational event in the history of Judaism, as it 
			underpins the entire religion.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">God as the one who saves</div>
			<div class="text">The importance of the events associated with this expression of the Covenant is that 
			they convey the notion of God's intervention in human history. This intervention provides a fundamental 
			insight into the nature of God. Namely <b>God is the one who saves</b>. God's intervention in human history is a 
			movement from slavery to freedom, from oppression to liberation. It is this understanding of the nature 
			of God which has profoundly shaped the development of Judaism.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Obligation - acceptance of 10 commandments</div>
			<div class="text">The significance of the Exodus experience is found in the way in which the People of 
			Israel understood and interpreted this event. God saved the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt, and 
			the people of Israel in return were obliged to accept the Ten Commandments.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Significance of the covenant</div>
			<div class="text">This expression of the Covenant is highly significant for numerous reasons: Firstly, 
			it shows that the people of Israel were to be the chosen people. Secondly it highlights God's care 
			for the people of Israel in granting them freedom. In essence, the importance of the Covenant can be 
			seen as thus: the Covenant is a reflection of the <b>Israelites discovering a God who is interested in 
			their welfare and gave them an identity by intervening in their fate</b>.
			<p>The Covenant made with Moses on Mount Sinai was an extension and reaffirmation of the one made with 
			Abraham. The people's agreement to it was expressed in the form of sacrifices to God. The blood from the 
			sacrificed animals was splashed on the people to consecrate them with God. That is, they were distinguished 
			from other people in the area and regarded themselves as the People of God.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Covenant with King David</div>
			<div class="text">In the later parts of the Tenak there are similar but more particular expressions of the 
			Covenant in terms of King David. David is a humble shepherd boy and God chooses him to be a powerful 
			and victorious king. In return, David has to walk in God's way by being a just and fair ruler.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Essence of covenantal obligations</div>
			<div class="text">The Covenant is significant because it expresses the ongoing relationship between 
			God and the people of Israel that lies at the very core of the Jewish tradition. The common obligation 
			that is similar to all these expressions of the Covenant is to <b>walk in God's way</b> and to act in such a 
			way that reflections their creation in God's image and likeness.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Exile and restoration</div>
			<div class="text">Intimately tied to the theme of the Covenant is the notion of exile and restoration. 
			The contours of Jewish history reflect this theme, as the people are blessed when they are faithful and 
			suffer the consequences when they are unfaithful.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">God is always faithful</div>
			<div class="text">Finally, it should be noted that the Covenant reflects an important attribute of God, 
			that God always remains faithful regardless of whether the people are faithful to the covenant. In other 
			words, God is always ready to embrace the people even when they turn their backs on God.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Observance</div>
			<div class="text">In the lived expression of Judaism, the idea of Covenant remains central. The observance 
			of the mitzvot of the Torah is essentially the response to the requirements of the Sinai Covenant. 
			Observant Jews will seek to keep the Torah in order to fulfill the requirements of the Covenant.</div>
