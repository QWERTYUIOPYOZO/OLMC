		<h1>Content Description </h1>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Covenant lies at the heart of Judaism</div>
			<div class="text">In Judaism the idea of <b>Covenant</b> is central to understanding the relationship between God and 
			the people of Israel. It can be said that the Covenant is at the heart of the religion. The relationship between
			God and the people as expressed in the Covenant is the <b>cornerstone of Judaism.</b></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">4 major expressions of the covenant</div>
			<div class="text">In Jewish tradition the idea of the Covenant occurs in a number of places. It occurs firstly 
			with Noah in the context of the flood (Genesis 9). It then occurs with Abraham and Sarah in relation to the 
			promise of descendents and a promised land (Genesis 12-17). The third occasion is in the context of Moses and 
			the Exodus event, known as the <b>Sinai covenant</b> (Exodus 19). Finally it is found in relation to the monarch 
			David (1 Chronicles 13)</p>
			<p>In Judaism, <b>Abraham</b> his son <b>Isaac</b> and grandson <b>Jacob</b> are known as the <b>Patriarchs</b>. It is in and through them 
			that the Covenant is brought to fruition.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Covenantal relationship</div>
			<div class="text">Principally the Covenant with the Patriarchs is an act which welds together God and the 
			chosen people, the Hebrews. The Covenant involves a relationship between God and the Hebrews where the people 
			are required to live according to the law prescribed by God and in return they are assured of God's blessing 
			and protection.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Noah - God's promise and Noah's obligations</div>
			<div class="text">The first expression of the Covenant is in relation to Noah after the flood. Noah and his 
			descendents are to live according to the ways of God. In the Covenant with Noah the emphasis of the law is on 
			<b>stewardship of creation</b> and respect for other human beings (Genesis 9:5). In return, God promises that the 
			earth will never again be destroyed by flood (Genesis 9:15). The rainbow in the sky is to be the sign of the 
			Covenant.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Abraham - God's promise</div>
			<div class="text">The next expression of the Covenant is in relation to Abraham. It occurs in a series of 
			encounters with God found in chapters 12-17 of the book of Genesis. It begins with the call of Abraham in 
			Genesis 12:1 where he is called by God to leave his own territory and move to the land shown to him by God. 
			This call includes the promise that he will become a <b>great nation.</b></p>
			<p>In chapter 15 there is a further encounter with God at Hebron. In this encounter God reassures Abraham, 
			despite the fact that his marriage remains childless, that his <b>descendents</b> would number as many as the stars 
			in the sky (Genesis 15:5).</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Abraham's covenantal obligations </div>
			<div class="text">The third encounter, found in chapter 17, has Abraham being called to <b>walk in the presence of 
			God</b> and be blameless (Genesis 17:1). His name is also changed from Abram to Abraham and his wife's name is 
			changed from Sarai to Sarah. In Genesis verses 9-14 Abraham is commanded that he and his descendents must 
			keep the Covenant with God throughout the ages and that <b>circumcision</b> is to be the sign of this Covenant.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Isaac</div>
			<div class="text">The elements of the Covenant are confirmed in response to Abraham's obedience in relation to the 
			sacrifice of his son Isaac. The story in chapter 22 of Genesis affirms that because of Abraham's fidelity in not 
			withholding his son he would be blessed abundantly and that his descendents would be as numerous as the stars of the 
			sky and the sands of the seashore, that he would possess the land promised to him and that through his descendents 
			all the nations of the earth would find blessing.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">2 key elements of promise - descendants and land</div>
			<div class="text">The Covenant with Abraham has two essential elements of promise. The first is that Abraham's 
			descendents would be numerous and would lead to the formation of a great nation. This promise was made at a 
			time when the marriage of Abraham and Sarah remained childless and when they were both beyond childbearing age.</p>
			<p>The second element of the Covenant promise is the possession of a promised land. This land is the biblical 
			land of <b>Canaan</b> which is the modern day state of Israel and the Palestinian territories.</p>
			<p>The Covenant with Abraham is seen in effect immediately with the birth of Isaac whose son Jacob is the father 
			of twelve sons who are identified with the <b>twelve tribes of Israel</b>. These twelve tribes are the loose 
			confederation which is ultimately united under the monarchy of Saul, David and Solomon.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Canaan</div>
			<div class="text">The land of Canaan is the land ultimately conquered and settled by Joshua and the tribes of 
			Israel after the death of Moses. Over time the land has been threatened and captured by various invading forces 
			yet it has remained an important element in the Jewish understanding of the Covenant.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Fidelity to the covenant</div>
			<div class="text">In order to inherit the blessings of the Covenant, the people of Israel are required to 
			remain faithful to the requirements of the Covenant. These requirements are originally expressed in simple 
			terms such as the call of Abraham to "walk in the presence of God and be blameless" (Genesis 17:1). It is 
			also from the time of Abraham that circumcision was required as a sign of the Covenant.</p>
			<p>The requirements of Covenant fidelity were later expressed more fully at Sinai with the giving of the Torah 
			to Moses. The keeping of the mitzvot of the Torah is now the fundamental measure of fidelity to the Covenant.</p></div>
