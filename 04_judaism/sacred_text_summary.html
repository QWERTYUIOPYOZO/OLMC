		  <li>The Talmud</li>
		</ul>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>The Hebrew Bible known as the Te na k is made up of three sections: Torah (T), Nevi'im (N), and Ketuvim (K). </li>
          <li>It is also customary to use the term "Torah" to refer to the whole Hebrew Bible. </li>
          <li>Torah is the books of Jewish law. Variously known as the books of the law, the books of Moses and the Pentateuch. </li>
          <li>Torah is the most important part of the Tenak because it contains the expression of the Covenant between God and the people of Israel </li>
          <li>Also sets out the law which Jewish people are obliged to follow. </li>
          <li>613 mitzvot regulate all aspects of the day to day life </li>
          <li>The highest mitzvot is the study of the Torah </li>
          <li>Nevi'im contains the books of the Prophets. </li>
          <li>Prophets remind Jewish people of the importance of remaining faithful to the Covenant </li>
          <li>The third section of the Torah is the Ketuvim or "writings" </li>
          <li>The most significant parts of the Ketuvim are the books of Psalms and Proverbs. </li>
          <li>The book of Psalms contains a mix of hymns of praise and lament. </li>
          <li>They are extremely important for their role in worship and prayer. </li>
          <li>The Proverbs are collections of short pithy statements expressing practical wisdom. </li>
          <li>Oral Torah is another important element of Jewish sacred texts and writings </li>
          <li>The Oral Torah is the interpretation and application of the Torah to changing circumstances over successive generations. </li>
          <li>Originally passed on in oral form </li>
          <li>Later came to be written down in collections </li>
          <li>The most important of these collections is known as the Mishnah. </li>
          <li>The Mishnah was finalised in written form around 200 CE. </li>
          <li>The second significant collection of the Oral Torah is known as the Gemara </li>
          <li>Gemara is essentially a commentary on the Mishnah. </li>
          <li>The Gemara was developed between 300 and 500 CE. </li>
          <li>Mishnah and Gemara were collected together during the 5 th and 6 th centuries CE to form the Talmud. </li>
          <li>The Talmud contains two types of subject matter: Haggadah and Halakhah </li>
          <li>Halakhah is the rules and laws for living. </li>
          <li>Halakhah provides the detailed interpretation and application of the 613 mitzvot </li>
          <li>Haggadah which provides wisdom and guidance for the principles of Jewish life. </li>
          <li>There are two versions of the Talmud </li>
          <li>The Babylonian version known as Bavli. </li>
          <li>The Palestinian version known as Yerushalmi. </li>
          <li>Moses Maimonides' development of the Mishneh Torah in codifying the Talmud has facilitated the study and use of the Talmud </li>
          <li>Talmud is always at the service of the Written Torah. </li>
          <li>The Talmud draws from the Torah and relies on the Torah.</li>
