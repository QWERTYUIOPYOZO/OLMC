	    <h1>Content Description </h1>
	    	<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Wisdom literature</div>
			<div class="text">The third part of the Tenak known as "Ketuvim" is a collection of writings which belong 
			loosely to a genre known as <b>Wisdom literature</b>. Wisdom literature is recognisable through its pithy 
			sayings upholding moral living and prudent judgement.
			<p>The book of Proverbs is classically in the mould of Wisdom literature as chapter after chapter 
			provides short sayings extolling the virtue of wisdom and lamenting imprudent behaviour.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Distich</div>
			<div class="text">The Proverbs generally follow a literary form known as distich which is a form of 
			parallelism where a statement is made and then repeated in a slightly different form to give emphasis 
			to the point e.g. "My son, walk not in the way with them, hold back your foot from their path" 
			(Proverbs 1:15). There is no actual difference in meaning between the two parts of the distich, rather 
			the second point is a slightly varied reiteration of the first.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Practical wisdom for prudent living</div>
			<div class="text">The book of Proverbs is not a source of profound theological insight and reflection. 
			Rather it is a <b>practical guide</b>, simply stated and in down to earth terms. It does not require any 
			sophisticated exegesis to unpack its meaning. It is simply a collection of statements expressing practical 
			wisdom in very direct ways for all to follow.
			<p>Traditionally the book of Proverbs is attributed to <b>King Solomon</b> whose wisdom was of legendary status. 
			Modern scholarship attributes the collection of proverbs to a number of sources and to a process of 
			development spanning centuries.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Feminine depictions of God</div>
			<div class="text">One of the interesting characteristics of the Wisdom literature is its propensity to 
			portray God in feminine terms in contrast to the predominant masculine images associated with the 
			patriarchal culture of the times. Proverbs chapter 3 is such an example, including a personification of 
			Wisdom where feminine images are used rather than the typical male images.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Wisdom</div>
			<div class="text"><b>Wisdom</b> is the primary concern of the book of Proverbs which presents it in terms of a 
			<b>reciprocal relationship</b>. It is presented as the path by which a person comes to knowledge of God. God 
			is also shown as being the source of Wisdom. Thus Wisdom comes from God and Wisdom leads a person to 
			God (Proverbs 2:5-6).
			<p>In addition to Wisdom being inextricably connected to God there is also a strong sense that Wisdom is 
			a powerful and <b>effective force</b> than will bring well being to those who seek it. "A wise man is more 
			powerful than a strong man and a man of knowledge than a man of might" (Proverbs 24:5). The pursuit of 
			Wisdom will therefore enable a person to prosper and thrive. In contrast the "fool" is often portrayed 
			as being on unstable footing and likely to be ruined.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Righteousness</div>
			<div class="text">A second significant element found in the book of Proverbs is the focus on righteousness. 
			There is a strong emphasis on righteousness and integrity throughout the book. The writers stress 
			that true happiness accompanies the person of integrity regardless of their situation in life. 
			"Better a poor man who walks in his integrity than he who is crooked in his ways and rich" (Proverbs 19:1). 
			In conjunction with this is the idea that an upright or righteous person will experience <b>well being 
			through their honesty</b> while a dishonest or faithless person will ultimately be brought down through 
			their lack of integrity. "The honesty of the upright guides them: the faithless are ruined by their 
			duplicity" (Proverbs 11:3).</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Purity</div>
			<div class="text">The emphasis on purity is the third significant focus of the book of Proverbs. The 
			meaning here is very similar to the idea of righteousness. The Proverbs praise the kind of purity and 
			integrity that focus on the things of <b>true value</b> rather than those of dubious worth. "Wealth is useless 
			on the day of wrath but virtue saves from death" (Proverbs 11:4).
			<p>A further element relates to the capacity of a person to judge their own motives and actions. The Proverbs 
			warn that God's scrutiny is far more perceptive and reveals any lack of integrity. "All the ways of a 
			man may be pure in his own eyes but it is the Lord who proves the spirit" (Proverbs 16:2).</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Generosity of spirit</div>
			<div class="text">The fourth important focus of the book of Proverbs is the aspect of generosity of 
			spirit. In keeping with the broader Jewish tradition of <b>care for the poor and oppressed</b> the Proverbs 
			clearly express the need to reach out to those in need. "If you remain indifferent in time of adversity 
			your strength will depart from you" (Proverbs 24:10). Additionally there is a strong sense that God's 
			blessing will be upon those who act generously to the poor while those who do not will suffer the 
			consequences of their selfishness. "He who gives to the poor suffers no want but he who ignores them 
			gets many a curse" (Proverbs 28:27).
			<p>The concluding chapter of Proverbs provides an interesting summary of some of the main ideas found 
			in the book. In chapter 31 from verse 10 until verse 31 there is a section extolling the virtues of 
			an outstanding woman. This section is sometimes referred to as "the ideal wife" or "the woman of valor". 
			Most significantly it details the qualities and achievements of this woman who personifies the aspects 
			of Wisdom discussed above. She is prudent in her judgement, just in her actions and pure in her 
			intentions. As a consequence she enjoys a rewarding life of blessing and the respect of all who know her.</p></div>
