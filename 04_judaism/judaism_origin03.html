		<h1>Content Description </h1>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Historical context </div>
			<div class="text">The tradition of the Exodus begins with the Hebrews in Egypt following the story of Joseph. 
			Over the passage of time the situation has worsened considerably for the Hebrews. Having once enjoyed a favoured 
			status in Egypt they have now been reduced to the situation of slaves.</p>
			<p>The <b>oppression of the Hebrews</b> reached a highpoint with the decree of the Pharaoh to execute any male child 
			born to the Hebrews (Exodus 1:15-22). It is in this environment that the child Moses was born. However, due 
			to the cunning of the midwives in subverting the Pharaoh's decree, Moses' life was spared and he came to be a
			dopted by the Pharaoh's daughter (Exodus 2:1-10).</p>
			<p>Having killed an Egyptian who was beating one of the Hebrews, Moses was forced to flee to save his life 
			taking refuge in Midian. In the course of his sojourn in Midian, Moses experienced and extraordinary encounter 
			with God in the story of the <b>burning bush at Horeb</b> (Exodus 3:1-22).</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Moses' encounter with God at Horeb</div>
			<div class="text">This encounter comes in the form of God calling Moses for the mission of liberating the 
			Hebrew people from their captivity in Egypt. God is announced to Moses as "the God of your father.the God 
			of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob" (Exodus 3:6).</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Moses' mission</div>
			<div class="text">The story continues with God's lament for the suffering of the Hebrews in Egypt and God's 
			proclamation of their rescue and deliverance to "a land flowing with milk and honey" (Exodus 3:8). 
			God also announces that Moses is to be the one to lead the people out of Egypt. Moses protests 
			that he is not capable of the task but God responds "I will be with you: and this shall be your 
			proof that it is I who have sent you: when you bring my people out of Egypt, you will worship God on 
			this very mountain" (Exodus 3:12).</p>
			<p>As the encounter proceeds the name of God is revealed to Moses. This name is regarded as sacred in the Jewish 
			tradition and is not spoken out of reverence for God.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Moses petitions the Pharaoh</div>
			<div class="text">Following this encounter Moses returned to Egypt with his brother Aaron. On their return 
			Moses and Aaron petitioned Pharaoh to release the Hebrews from slavery, however, their request was refused. 
			Not only was the request refused but the treatment of the Hebrews worsened. As a consequence Moses and Aaron 
			were subjected to the complaints of their people for making their situation worse.</p>
			<p>God then sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh with the threat of catastrophe. Once again the petition was rejected 
			and as a consequence the first of the plagues occurs, the water turned into blood. This was followed by 
			eight other plagues, however, the Pharaoh continued to reject the petition (Exodus 7:25-10:29).</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Death of the first born</div>
			<div class="text">After the ninth plague, God instructed Moses to prepare for the tenth and final plague, the 
			death of the first born. The Hebrews were to prepare to escape in haste. They were to sacrifice a lamb and 
			daub <b>blood on the door</b> posts and lintel of the house to designate it as belonging to the Hebrews. During 
			the night the angel of the Lord passed through the land bringing about the death of the first born in every 
			house not marked with the blood as prescribed. The angel passed over the houses belonging to the Hebrews 
			sparing their first born.</p>
			<p>The <b>Passover</b> ritual in Judaism takes its name from the "passing over" of the Hebrew households during the 
			death of the first born. The ritual includes the elements drawn from the instructions given to the Hebrew 
			people on the night of the Exodus from Egypt (Exodus 12). The Passover ritual is one of the most significant 
			occasions in the Jewish calendar.</p>
			<p>Following the death of the first born, Pharaoh relented and allowed the Hebrews to go free. After the Hebrews 
			had begun to escape, Pharaoh changed his mind and sent his army in pursuit of the fleeing Hebrews.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Red Sea</div>
			<div class="text">This pursuit climaxed at the Red Sea where Moses was instructed by God to stretch out his 
			staff over the water which parted allowing the Hebrews to cross to the other side. In their pursuit the 
			Egyptian army attempted to take the same course, however, Moses stretched out his hand again and the water 
			flowed back in its place drowning the Egyptians who were pursuing them (Exodus 14:21-28).</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Exodus - The foundational moment in Judaism</div>
			<div class="text">The process of the Hebrew people being liberated from their captivity in Egypt is known as the 
			Exodus. It is a defining moment in the Jewish tradition and is seen as foundational for the tradition. In this 
			moment of liberation the Hebrew people experience the saving action of God. They experience the reality of 
			God's intervention in human history and they learn of <b>God's concern for those who are oppressed</b>.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">God's saving action</div>
			<div class="text">The Exodus is a profound moment of understanding for the Jewish people. In and through the 
			Exodus they come to understand God's intervention as a saving action overcoming oppression and leading to 
			freedom. This liberating action is seen as characteristic of God and the concern God has for the poor and 
			disadvantaged.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Importance of liberation in Jewish ethics</div>
			<div class="text">Not only does the Exodus stand as a foundational moment in the Jewish tradition, it also 
			significantly defines the ethics of Judaism in rejecting oppression and working towards the <b>liberation of 
			all people</b>.</p>
			<p>After crossing the Red Sea the Hebrew people were sustained in the wilderness through Quail and Manna and 
			water which flowed from rock (Exodus 16). They continued journeying in the desert until they reached Mount 
			Sinai.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Sinai covenant</div>
			<div class="text">Exodus chapter 19 begins the climactic experience of Moses' encounter with God at Sinai. 
			It begins with a reiteration of the covenant made with Abraham. "If you listen to my voice and keep my covenant 
			you shall be my special possession, dearer to me than all other people. You shall be to me a kingdom of priests, 
			a holy nation" (Exodus 19:5-6).</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Ten Commandments</div>
			<div class="text">The experience continues with the great theophany where Moses encounters God face to face on 
			Mount Sinai. In this encounter Moses receives the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17).</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Torah lies at the heart of Judaism</div>
			<div class="text">These commandments are the beginning of what is referred to as the <b>Sinai law</b>. This law is the 
			Torah, the very heart of the Jewish tradition. The Torah spells out the expected response of the Jewish people 
			to the requirements of the Covenant.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">613 mitzvot</div>
			<div class="text">The Ten Commandments are followed immediately in the text by numerous laws <b>governing all 
			aspects of community life</b>. Interspersed among these laws are statements ratifying the Covenant (Exodus 24:1-11). 
			The chapters of laws amount to 613 including the Ten Commandments. These are the 613 mitzvot of the Torah which 
			are required to be followed by observant Jews.</p>
			<p>The 613 mitzvot of the Torah form the basis for the actions of Jewish people in relation to every aspect of 
			life. They govern religious ritual, interpersonal relationships, business dealings, dietary requirements and a 
			myriad of other concerns.</p></div>
