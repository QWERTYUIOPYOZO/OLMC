						<ol class="alpha">
						  <li>He will become the head of a great nation.</li>
						  <li>God will provide him with a land of his own, the Promised Land of Canaan. 
						    God then instructs him to leave his own territory in southern Mesopotamia.</li>

						<li>In Hebron, God promises that:</li>
                        <ol class="alpha">
						  <li>Abraham's descendents will be as numerous as the stars, in response to Abraham's

		                <li>God requests the sacrifice of Isaac, the only son of Abraham and Sarah, and Abraham complies with 
					      this command. At the last minute the angel of God intervenes and saves Isaac from death. God 
					      reaffirms the dual promise of descendants and land in response to Abraham's fidelity.</li>
