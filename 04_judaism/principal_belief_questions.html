	    <h1>Specimen Questions </h1>
	    <p><b> Analyse the significance of the Covenant for the practice of Judaism today.</b></p>
	    <h2>Sample Responses </h2>
	    <p> <b> Analyse the significance of the Covenant for the practice of Judaism today.</b></p>
	    <p> The Covenant is of critical importance to Judaism today, as it still lies at the heart of the Jewish religion 
		and governs Jewish life and hence its importance transcends the historical timeframe in which it was given by God. 
		The Covenant is a series of agreements recorded in the Hebrew Bible between God and Israel.</p>
	    <p> Essentially, because the Covenant is the key indicator of an intimate relationship between God and the People 
		of Israel it follows, therefore, that the covenantal relationship is the principle that underpins the Jewish religion 
		throughout its history and in the modern times.</p>
	    <p> The covenantal relationship is important essentially because of two reasons: firstly, it shows that the people 
		of Israel were marked out to be the chosen people and secondly it highlights the existence of a God that cares about 
		the welfare of the people by intervening in their fate. Flowing from this covenantal relationship are the 
		all-important principles in Jewish thinking of freedom, fidelity and care for the oppressed.</p>
	    <p> The first reason why the Covenant is of critical importance to both the evolutionary history and the 
		contemporary framework of Judaism today is because the Covenant is the key signifier of a close relationship 
		between God and the People of Israel. Basically, Judaism is premised on the very fact that the Covenant is a 
		reflection of the Israelites encountering a God who is interested in their welfare and gave them an identity by 
		intervening in their fate.</p>
	    <p> This intimate relationship can be seen by recalling God's great acts of salvation. These acts, which show the 
		existence of a God, who cares for the welfare of the Jewish people, are most clearly manifested in the four key 
		expressions of the Covenant in Jewish history. Firstly, God saves Noah and his family from the Great Flood. 
		Secondly, God brings Abraham out of Ur in Mesopotamia and into Canaan, the Promised Land. Next God saves Moses 
		and the people of Israel from slavery from Egypt. It can be argued that this event is the foundational event of 
		Judaism.</p>
	    <p> In the later books of the Bible, we hear of God choosing David, a humble shepherd boy to become a powerful 
		and victorious king. Through these great acts the Jewish people came to discover their identity as the chosen 
		people of God. They also came to understand that a core part of this identity involves the notion of freedom. 
		This belief which can be found in many aspects of Jewish thought today stems from the memory of being saved 
		from slavery in Egypt.</p>
	    <p> The second reason for the importance of the Covenant for the practice of Judaism today is that it is from 
		this covenantal relationship that the Jewish people come to learn how to respond to God and treat their fellow 
		human beings.</p>
	    <p> The covenantal relationship the cornerstone of the Jewish religion. God's intervention in their history is 
		the way through which the love of God is made real. Therefore if follows that keeping the requirements of the 
		Covenant is the primary concern of Jewish observance. Thus, the main focus of Judaism which is premised on the 
		day to day observance of halakhic laws is derived from this covenantal relationship.</p>
	    <p> Associated with the covenantal relationship are certain obligations and commandments which God has instructed 
		the people of Israel to observe. In the Covenant made between Noah and God, Noah was obliged to live by caring for 
		the earth, humankind and all of creation. That is, Noah was called to live in God's image and walk in God's path.</p>
	    <p> In the Covenant between Abraham and God, Abraham was called to live in a righteous and just way. In the third 
		expression of the Covenant, that is, the Covenant between Moses and God, the people were obliged to accept the 
		Ten Commandments as a sign of gratitude and acknowledgement of the greatness of God in rescuing the people of 
		Moses from slavery in Egypt.</p>
	    <p> This Covenant was an extension and reaffirmation of the covenant made with Abraham. The Covenant with 
		David also follows this general pattern of recalling the great acts of God which includes commandments for 
		people to follow, even though this expression of the Covenant was of a more particular nature. The tradition 
		teaches that in return for God's graciousness King David has to walk in God's way by being a just and fair king.</p>
	    <p> In summary the common obligation that is similar to all these expressions of the Covenant is to walk in 
		God's way and to act in such a way that reflects their creation as being made in the likeness and image of God.</p>
	    <p> The third reason why the Covenant is of contemporary significance to the practice of Judaism today is its 
		underpinning of the halakhic requirements which govern the day to day life of Jews. This concept of fidelity to 
		the Covenant is at the heart of Jewish observance.</p>
	    <p> The contours of Jewish history are a reflection of the consequences of fidelity and infidelity. Events such 
		as Exodus, the Monarchy, and the Restoration from exile draw a direct relation between fidelity and the positive 
		consequences of freedom, peace and prosperity. In contrast to the blessings of fidelity, infidelity in failing to 
		keep the Covenant results brings dire consequences and threatens the security of the people. This is most 
		powerfully seen in the Babylonian exile.</p>
	    <p> Thus, the principle underlying halakhic practice, which is of central importance to Judaism, is this notion of 
		fidelity to the Covenant and the positive consequences that flow from this fidelity.</p>
	    <p> Therefore it is evident that the Covenant is not merely an historical phenomenon that is only important for 
		people of the distant past. Rather it is still the underlying concept that governs the day to day life of Jewish 
		life today.</p>
	    <p> The fourth reason why the Covenant is significant for the practice of Judaism today is that it emphasises 
		that the notion that fidelity is a key attribute of God. The covenantal relationship shows that God is always 
		faithful even when the Israelites are not faithful to the covenant.</p>
	    <p> The message that comes across from examining the covenantal relationship is that God is always ready to embrace 
		the people, however, sometimes the people of Israel will choose to turn their backs on God. Thus, fidelity is both 
		an attribute of God and an indicator of how God relates to people. The essential descriptor of the fidelity of God 
		is the everlasting Covenant.</p>
	    <p> In conclusion, the Covenant is significant for the practice of Judaism today because it expresses the ongoing 
		relationship between God and the people of Israel that lies at the core of the Jewish religion. The covenantal 
		relationship is important because by recalling God's great acts the Israelites discover a God who is interested in 
		their welfare and gave them an identity by intervening in their fate. Associated with these are blessings which 
		underpin the strict observance of halakhic laws.</p>
	    Finally, the Covenant is important because it reflects an important attribute of God, the attribute of fidelity. 
		Thus, the Covenant is of great significance for the practice of Judaism today as the Covenant is the cornerstone 
		of the Jewish religion as it reflects an intimate relationship between God and the People of Israel.
