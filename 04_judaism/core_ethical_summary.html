        <ul class="section_statement">
          <li>The Prophetic Vision, including social justice and Tikkun Olam - the repair of the world</li>
        </ul>
		<ul class="summary_points">
	      <li>Prophetic tradition</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>The Prophets were individuals who were called by God to proclaim the message that people were straying from the path laid down by the Torah by perpetuating the status quo of society. <b></b></li>
            <li>The Prophets advocated a pro-active stance to reforming social structures by emphasizing the broad themes of justice, equality and peace during a time when these concepts were of secondary importance compared to observance of law and ritual. <b></b></li>
            <li>The Prophets were actively concerned with bettering the plight of the poor, the needy and the oppressed and did so by challenging the authority figures of society. </li>
          </ul>
	      <li>Tikkun Olam</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>Definition - Repair/transformation of the world. <b></b></li>
            <li>Tikkun olam is the notion that if a person saves another human being it is as if that person had saved the whole world. <b></b></li>
            <li>Significance - The overarching principle of tikkun olam in Jewish ethics is intimately connected with the idea of social justice. <b></b></li>
            <li>The implication of this notion is that all individuals have the dual responsibility of rectifying inequalities in society by helping the poor and needy, and acting as a steward by caring for the earth. <b></b></li>
            <li>The aim of tikkun olam is to achieve a perfected world, or "haMascheach". </li>
          </ul>
	      <li>Gemilut Chasidim</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>Definition - Acts of loving kindness such as visiting the sick, feeding the poor and comforting the mourner. </li>
            <li>Significance - It is identified as the characteristic that encapsulates the Jewish identity. </li>
            <li>Gemilut Chasidim is intimately tied with the notion of leading a righteous life and having a good heart which are prerequisites of being a truly devout individual.</li>
          </ul>
	      <li>Tzedakah</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>Definition - charity </li>
            <li>All Jews are required to give tzedakah within means which are reasonable for each individual as part of the process of seeking a just world. </li>
            <li>Tzedakah also stresses the importance of the means by which one gives charity. </li>
          </ul>
	      <li>Bal Tashkit</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>Definition - Do not destroy </li>
            <li>This notion prohibits the unnecessary destruction of God's creation because then another person will not be able to utilise God's gifts to the world. </li>
            <li>Significance - This notion is intimately connected with modern ecological concerns in emphasizing the importance of human stewardship over the earth.</li>

          <li>The Book of Proverbs - wisdom, righteousness, purity and generosity of spirit</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="summary_points">
          <li>The Book of Proverbs is one of the most significant collections within the genre of Wisdom literature. <b></b></li>
          <li>The Book of Proverbs is a collection of short, pithy statements which offer practical and simple advice on how to lead a moral life and behave prudently.</li>
		  <li>Wisdom</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>The major theme dealt with in the Book of Proverbs is that of wisdom. </li>
            <li>God is the source of wisdom. </li>
            <li>Wisdom is also the means by which a person comes to know God. </li>
            <li>Wisdom is a powerful force that will bring well being to those who seek it. (Proverbs 24:5) </li>
          </ul>
	      <li>Righteousness</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>A person who lives righteously and with integrity will live a happy life regardless of their situation (Proverbs 19:1) </li>
            <li>A person's lack of integrity or faith will ultimately lead to their ruin (Proverbs 11:3)</li>
          </ul>
	      <li>Purity</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>Purity which is linked to integrity is a virtue that has true value and hence should be praised (Proverbs 11:4). </li>
          </ul>
	      <li>Generosity of spirit</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>Generosity of spirit involves helping society's poor and vulnerable (Proverbs 24:10). </li>
            <li>God will bless those who are generous to the poor and needy, while those who do not will suffer negative consequences as a result of their selfishness (Proverbs 28:27)</li>
          </ul>

		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Jews are expected to place considerable emphasis on the extensive ethical teachings of the tradition in making informed moral choices. <b></b></li>
          <li>Since Judaism is essentially a practical religion the halakhah assists Jews to apply the general principles contained in the Torah to daily ethical issues. <b></b></li>
          <li>Talmudic scholars and halakhic lawyers have a central role in providing the day to day guidance on ethical matters. <b></b></li>
          <li>The general ethical direction in the life of a Jewish person is determined by the Ten Commandments. <b></b></li>
          <li>The Ten Commandments contained in Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21 is regarded as a distillation of the 613 mitzvot contained in the Torah. <b></b></li>
          <li>These 613 mitzvot contain both positive mitzvot ("to do" commands) and negative mitzvot (commands to refrain from doing something). <b></b></li>
          <li>The general themes of righteousness, purity and justice underpin the specific halakhic laws that guide Jewish ethical decision making.</li>
