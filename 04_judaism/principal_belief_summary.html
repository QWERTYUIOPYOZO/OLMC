	    <h1>Summary Points</h1>
	    <h3>Students learn about:</h3>
	    <p class="section_statement">Belief in a single God who is the creator and ruler of the universe.</p>
	    <h3>Students learn to:</h3>
	    <p class="section_statement">Discuss the belief in the one God and the attributes of God.</p>
		<ul class="summary_points">
	      <li>God is One</li>
	      <li class="marker_off">Implications of this belief:</li>
	      <ol>
	        <li>Only one God</li>
	        <li>God is indivisible</li>
	        <li>God is unique</li>
          </ol>
		  <li class="marker_off">The centrality of this belief is reflected in the prayer, the Shema, "Hear O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is One&rdquo;.</li>
	      <li>God is Eternal</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>God has always existed and will always exist.</li>
            <li>God is the source of all creation, since God existed before creation.</li>
            <li>God will exist even after creation ceases to exist.</li>
            <li>The ultimate destiny of human beings lies with God in eternity.</li>
          </ul>
		  <li>God is Omnipresent</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>God is everywhere and is intimately involved with human history. </li>
            <li>God's intervention in history is most evident in the account of the Exodus. </li>
            <li>The liberation from slavery in Egypt is regarded as the foundational and defining moment in Jewish history.</li>
          </ul>
		  <li>God is Omnipotent</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>God is all powerful and hence all knowing. </li>
            <li>God can change future events. </li>
            <li>The events of the Exodus demonstrate that no obstacle is too great for God to overcome. </li>
            <li>It is difficult to reconcile the notion that God knows and can control the future with the concept that human beings have free will. </li>
            <li>Maimonides said that we cannot sufficiently answer this question because human knowledge is finite, whereas God's knowledge is infinite.</li>
          </ul>
		  <li>God is Pure Spirit</li>
	      <ul>
            <li>The anthropomorphic depictions of God (eg hand of God, eye of God) are rationally unsound because the finite limit of human knowledge is unable to comprehend the full nature of God. </li>
            <li>God's spirit is manifested throughout the universe.</li>
            <li>Human beings cannot know God through direct means.</li>
            <li>Human beings come to understand the nature of God as being pure spirit through mediated knowledge such as witnessing His intervention in human history, creation and the sacred texts.</li>

	    <h3>Students learn about:</h3>
	    <p class="section_statement">The concept of a moral law prescribed by God</p>
	    <h3>Students learn to:</h3>
	    <p class="section_statement">Outline the concept of a divinely inspired moral law</p>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li> God gave Jews a code of ethics which is intended to guide them in relation to ethical decision making in keeping with their dignity as God's creation. </li>
          <li> Since theological understanding is secondary to practice in Judaism, the primary responsibility of Jews is to study the Torah, which the principal source of God's revelation, in order to behave appropriately in response to moral questions. </li>
          <li> Orthodox Judaism - The moral code laid down by God is complete and non-evolving in its application to all situations for the past, present and future. </li>
          <li> The main role of Talmudic scholars and halakhic lawyers is to find the exact authority within the text to justify behaviour for the case at hand. </li>
          <li> Progressive Judaism - The Written Torah is open to some re-interpretation in light of changing circumstances as the text does not represent the literal word of God. </li>
          <li> Progressive Judaism - Place greater emphasis on the broad principles established in the moral to guide ethical decision making in new situations. </li>
          <li> The most basic formulation of the moral law is found in the Ten Commandments. </li>
          <li> The aim of the Ten Commandments is to lay down a path for humans to follow, so that they can relate to another in a way that is in accordance with their creation as God's creatures. </li>
          <li>The theme of liberation from oppression, as drawn from the events of the Exodus underpins the moral code provided by God. </li>
	    </ul>
        <h3>Students learn about:</h3>
	    <p class="section_statement">The idea of the Covenant.</p>
	    <h3>Students learn to:</h3>
	    <p class="section_statement">Identify the importance of the Covenant for the Jewish people.</p>
		<ul class="summary_points">
	      <li>Definition - The Covenant is a series of agreements recorded in the Hebrew Bible between God and the people of Israel. </li>
	      <li>Importance of the Covenant - The Covenant lies at the heart of the Jewish religion and is the cornerstone of Judaism. </li>
	      <li>There are four main expressions of the Covenant made between God and the people of Israel:</li>
		  <ol>
		    <li>Noah</li>
			<ul class="indented_sub_points">
			  <li><em>God's promise</em> - God saves Noah and his family from the flood.</li>
			  <li><em>Obligation</em> - Noah and his family are called to live in God's image and to walk in God's path by caring for the earth, humankind and all of creation.</li> 
			  <li><em>Blessings/curses</em> - God will exact vengeance for wrongful acts. However, if Noah is faithful to his covenantal obligations, then a disaster like the flood will not happen again.</li>
			  <li><em>Sign of the covenant</em> - Rainbow</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Abraham</li>
			<ul class="indented_sub_points">
			  <li><em>God's promise</em> - </li>
			  <ol class="alpha">
			    <li>Abraham's descendants will be as numerous as the stars, and he will be the head of a great nation.</li>
				<li>Abraham's people will be given a land of their own, the land of Canaan (Promised Land). </li>
			  </ol>
			  <li><em>Obligation</em> - Abraham is obliged to walk in God's way, by living in a righteous and just way.</li>
			  <li><em>Sign of the covenant</em> - Brit milah (circumcision)</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Moses and the People of Israel</li>
			<ul class="indented_sub_points">
			  <li><em>God's promise</em> - Liberates the Hebrews from slavery in Egypt.</li>
			  <li><em>Obligation</em> - Hebrews were obliged to accept the Ten Commandments.</li>
			  <li><em>Importance of this covenant</em> - This covenant is the foundational event in the history of Judaism. This Covenant is essentially a reflection of the Israelites discovering a God who is interested in their welfare and gave them an identity by intervening in their fate. The implication of this belief is that:</li>
			  <ol class="alpha">
	            <li>The people of Israel discover that they are the Chosen People.</li>
                <li>Shows God's care for the people of Israel in granting them freedom. </li>
			  </ol>
			  <li><em>Sign of the covenant</em> - Animal sacrifices to God.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>David</li>
			<ul class="indented_sub_points">
			  <li><em>God's promise</em> - God chooses the humble shepherd David to become a powerful and victorious king.</li>
			  <li><em>Obligation</em> - David has to walk in God's way by being a just and fair ruler.</li>		  
			</ul>
		  </ol>
          <li>A key theme derived from the covenantal relationship is the notion of exile and restoration. </li>
          <li>This theme is reflected in the contours of Jewish history, where the people are blessed when they faithful and suffer the consequences when they are unfaithful. </li>
          <li>God is always faithful even when the people turn their backs to God and the Covenant. </li>
          <li>The observance of the mitzvot is important as it is the primary means to keep the requirements of the Sinai covenant.</li>
