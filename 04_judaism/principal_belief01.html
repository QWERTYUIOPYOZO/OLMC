<h1>Content Description </h1>
	<h2>God is One </h2>
	    <div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">One, unique, indivisible</div>
		<div class="text">The belief that God is One means has multiple nuances: firstly it means that there is <b>only 
		one God</b>, secondly that God is <b>indivisible</b> and thirdly that <b>God is unique</b>. The belief that God is One is central 
		to Judaism. This belief is reflected in the prayer, known as the <b>Shema</b>, which may be described as Israel's 
		declaration of faith, "Hear O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is One". This reflects Judaism's monotheistic 
		nature, which rejects any form of idolatry. God is regarded as being all powerful and the source of creation. 
		It follows, therefore, that there can be no other gods.</div>
		</div>
	<h2>God is Eternal</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">God has and will always exist</div>
		<div class="text">Jews believe that God is eternal in the sense that God has always existed and always will exist. 
		Thus there has not been a time when God has not existed. Since God is the source of creation then God must also 
		have existed before the dawn of creation.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">God is the source of creation</div>
		<div class="text">The belief that God is eternal is also a statement about God's relationship with creation. To 
		have existed before creation affirms that creation could only have been possible in and through the creative 
		activity of God. Prior to the creation there existed nothing apart from God. Accordingly all that exists derives 
		from God who is the <b>source of creation</b>.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Human beings are created by God</div>
		<div class="text">This same belief that God is eternal also has implication for the origins and ultimate destiny of 
		humankind. It has already been noted that God is understood as the source of creation. Thus human beings also owe 
		their origins to God.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">The ultimate destiny of human beings lies with God</div>
		<div class="text">As God has existed for all of time, it follows that <b>God predates creation</b> and will also remain 
		beyond the end of creation. Through this understanding human beings are able to recognise that their <b>ultimate 
		destiny lies with God in eternity</b>.
		<p>The knowledge that the origin and destiny of humankind is found in God also provides a sense of purpose in living. 
		Namely to live according to the will of God revealed in the Torah.</p></div>
		</div>
	<h2>God is Omnipresent</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">God is intimately involved with human affairs</div>
		<div class="text">The belief that God is omnipresent is the belief that God is everywhere. This belief highlights 
		the fact that <b>God is intimately concerned with humankind</b> and human concerns. While God is understood as being a 
		transcendent being, God is also known as the one who intervenes in human history and acts on behalf of the 
		oppressed.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Intervention seen in the Exodus</div>
		<div class="text">The intervention is seen most powerfully in the account of the Exodus where God liberates the 
		Hebrew people from slavery in Egypt. This moment of liberation is regarded as the defining moment in the history 
		of Judaism.</div>
		</div>
	<h2>God is Omnipotent</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">God is all powerful and all knowing</div>
		<div class="text">Judaism teaches that God is all powerful and hence all knowing. For example, Jeremiah 32:19 
		tells us that God's "Eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways, 
		and according to the fruit of his doings". Thus it is recognised that there is <b>nothing that God cannot achieve</b> 
		and nothing that God cannot prevent. Since God is all knowing and all powerful, God therefore must also know and 
		be able to change what may happen in the future.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Exodus is an affirmation of God's power</div>
		<div class="text">The identity of the Hebrews as a people in biblical times is predicated on the display of the 
		power of God in liberating them from captivity in Egypt. The events of the Exodus demonstrate, among other things, 
		that no obstacle is too great for God to overcome.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Free will and God's knowledge</div>
		<div class="text">This then raises the stubborn issue of whether it is possible for human beings to have <b>free will</b>
		considering that God is knowledgeable about all that is to occur in the future? Maimonides concluded that 
		considering the finite limits of human knowledge people cannot sufficiently answer the problem because this 
		issue touches on God's knowledge which is completely beyond human understanding.</div>
		</div>		
	<h2>God is Pure Spirit</h2>

		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">God's spirit is manifested throughout the universe</div>
		<div class="text">In describing God there is a tendency to speak about the hand of God, the mind of God or the 
		eye of God. In other words, to use human attributes or characteristics in describing or depicting the activity 
		of God.
		<p>Maimonides teaches that this <b>anthropomorphic depiction is rationally unsound</b> because human beings are incapable 
		of ever knowing the full nature of God. Because God cannot legitimately be described as having a face or a hand, 
		one can conclude that God is pure spirit. This spirit is manifested throughout the universe. Thus human beings 
		cannot come to an understanding of the nature of God through direct means, that is knowing God directly or 
		in an unmediated way. Rather, human beings know God through indirect means or through <b>mediated knowledge</b>.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Indirect means of revelation</div>
		<div class="text">As God is pure spirit human beings need to have a mechanism by which they experience the 
		revelation of God. This may be through elements of creation, through the human attributes and through sacred 
		texts and rituals which human beings to encounter God.</div>
