	    <h1>Specimen Questions</h1>
	    <p><b> Outline the rituals associated with keeping Shabbat in Judaism and explain their significance for the Jewish beliefs about Shabbat observance.</b></p>
	    <p><b> Analyse the significance of Shabbat observance for Jewish people within the Conservative, Orthodox and Progressive strands of Judaism.</b>
        </p>
	    <h2>Sample Responses</h2>
	    <p><b> Outline the rituals associated with keeping Shabbat in Judaism and explain their significance for the Jewish beliefs about Shabbat observance.</b></p>
	    <p> The numerous rituals associated with keeping Shabbat reflect the fact that Jews believe that the Sabbath is a holy day and a day of rest where people are called upon to imitate God by resting on the seventh day of creation. The various rituals performed such as refraining from work, lighting two candles at the beginning of Shabbat, Kiddush, blessing the children and lighting the Havdalah candle are the physical manifestations of the two core beliefs about Shabbat, which is "Remember the Sabbath day" and "Keep the Sabbath day".</p>
	    <p> The essential meaning behind these two mitzvot is the idea that God is the ultimate creator and that God's act of creation should be seen as a gift to human beings. What is evident in the importance of keeping the Shabbat rituals is that Judaism is ultimately a religion that is mostly concerned with ritual observance, rather than theological debates, as a reflection of faith.</p>
	    <p> One of the most significant elements associated with keeping Shabbat is refraining from all forms of work. This practice is derived from the Biblical story where God rested on the seventh day after creating the world and hence all people are called to imitate God by resting every seventh day. The practice of ceasing from all forms of work is the physical embodiment of the commandment to "Remember the Sabbath day" (Exodus 20:8).</p>
	    <p> Many volumes have been dedicated to outlining the types of activities which fall under the category "work". These range from playing ball games in one's home to making money. There are four general categories of work listed in the Torah which are prohibited on the Sabbath. The Talmud applies these four general categories to more specific issues that arise from every day life. From this, they have instituted thirty nine prohibited categories of work. Talmudic scholars then went on to expand on the forms of work prohibited on the Shabbat to include utensils and objects which cannot be handled during Shabbat. Such objects are known as "muktzeh".</p>
	    <p> Refraining from all forms of work is essentially directed at recognising that God is the ultimate creator and that whilst human beings are partners with God in this creation, the act of creation is a gift from God and not an intrinsic right possessed by human beings.</p>
	    <p> Lighting two candles at the commencement of the Sabbath also symbolises the commandments, "Remember the Sabbath" (Exodus 20:8) and "Keep the Sabbath" (Deuteronomy 5:12), as each candle lit represents one of these two commandments. Similarly, the two loaves of bread known as "hallot" represent the two commandments "Keep the Sabbath" and "Remember the Sabbath". Usually these loaves are covered at the table.</p>
	    <p> Occasionally, when a person is unable to drink for health reasons or no wine is available, Kiddush can be recited over the two loaves of bread. Any two loaves of bread can be used provided that they are whole. The symbolism of this ritual is pointing at the idea that a person should approach the Sabbath and their religious observance wholeheartedly.</p>
	    <p> Shabbat is meant to be reserved as a holy day. It is considered as a day of rest and rejuvenation, a day of family and community and a time to study the Torah and attend the synagogue. Thus, attending the synagogue and spending time with family and friends highlights that the Sabbath has this extra dimension for Jews which is about joy of life and acknowledgement of God's presence in this joy.</p>
	    <p> The strong sense of community during Shabbat can be seen in the ritual element which takes place at the commencement of the Shabbat. The wife after she has lit the two Shabbat candles recites the benediction, "Who has commanded us to kindle the Sabbath lights", then proceeds to pray for the welfare of her family.</p>
	    <p> This acknowledgement of the presence of the transcendent God in the small joys of life is the idea that underpins the most important celebration that takes place on the Friday of Shabbat, that is, the Shabbat dinner. This dinner takes place at home with family and friends. The father blesses the children in order of age, before Kiddush is recited over the wine, which "gladdens the heart".</p>
	    <p> The Kiddush is an important Shabbat ritual that uses a verse from Genesis describing how God consecrated the Sabbath by resting on the seventh day. Thus, ritual observance reflects the Jewish beliefs about Shabbat. This recitation is followed by two benedictions, the first one over wine, and the second benediction is recited in gratitude to God for giving the Jewish people the Sabbath.</p>
	    <p> The concept of gratitude which underlies the ritual observance of Shabbat highlights the notion that merely observing the halakhic laws is not enough. One needs to enter into the occasion with a spirit of joy and wholeheartedly. On the Saturday of Shabbat, another meal is eaten. But before this takes place, Kiddush is conducted once again on the Sabbath theme. The highlight of the Saturday service is the reading of a specified segment of the Torah.</p>
	    <p> The sanctity of Shabbat lies in the fact that it is seen as a special day. It is affectionately known by Jews as the Queen of Days. The division between the sacred and the profane is marked in the ritual of lighting the havdalah candles. Havdalah is recited when three stars appear on the darkened sky at sunset. The havdalah is a prayer which praises God for creating distinctions between what is considered sacred and what is not, and between light and darkness. When the braided havdalah candle is lit, it is a sign that Shabbat has ended, hence lighting a fire is permissible again.</p>
	    In conclusion, the rituals associated with keeping Shabbat in Judaism reflect the belief that Shabbat is a holy day that is to be dedicated to God, by refraining from work, lighting candles at the commencement of the Shabbat, attending the synagogue with family and friends, and reciting Kiddush. These symbolic rituals draw attention to the greater reality of God as the ultimate creator and giver of life. This life, Shabbat reminds us, should be seen as a gift and subsequently we should approach life and religious practice with joy and wholeheartedly. In essence, the Sabbath rituals reflect the two mitzvot of "Remember the Sabbath" and "Keep the Sabbath".<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
