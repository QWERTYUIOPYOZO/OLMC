	    <h1>Content Description</h1>
	    	<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">God rested on the 7th day of creation</div>
			<div class="text">The practice of <b>Shabbat</b> is derived from the Biblical story where <b>God rested on the seventh 
			day</b> after creating the world and hence people are called to imitate God by resting every seventh day. Thus, 
			the Sabbath is a day of rest and rejuvenation, a day of family and community and a time to study the 
			Torah and attend the synagogue for Jewish people.
			<p>This view of the Sabbath as a holy and special day is expressed in Exodus 20:8 which calls people to 
			"Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy". The Sabbath is a most significant liturgical event of the week 
			because it reminds the Jewish people of the <b>greatness of God</b> in creating the world and humankind, and the 
			<b>importance of the Covenant</b> between God and the People of Israel, forged following the exodus from slavery.</p>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Covenantal obligations</div>
			<div class="text">In Exodus 31:16 the people are reminded to "Observe the Sabbath day throughout the 
			generations as an everlasting covenant". The importance of Shabbat is clearly evident in that it is 
			affectionately referred to by the Jewish people as the <b>Queen of Days</b>.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">2 primary Shabbat commandments</div>
			<div class="text">The requirements for keeping the Sabbath can be summed up by two commandments, 
			firstly <b>"Remember the Sabbath day"</b> (Exodus 20:8) which means refraining from all forms of work, 
			and secondly <b>"Keep the Sabbath day"</b> (Deuteronomy 5:12) which refers to reciting the <b>Kiddush</b> over 
			a cup of wine.
			<p>This emphasis on ritual highlights the fact that Judaism is largely concerned with carrying out 
			halakhic requirements as a reflection of faith rather than being a religion that is focused on a 
			detailed theological exploration of the concepts which underpin the religion. Admittedly, whilst this 
			is important, conceptual analysis is of secondary importance compared to how these concepts can be 
			brought into practice for believers on a day to day basis.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">All forms of work are prohibited</div>
			<div class="text">In relation to the negative mitzvot of ceasing from all forms of work, it should be noted 
			that all kinds of work and labor are prohibited on the Sabbath. In essence, by <b>ceasing all forms of work</b> 
			Jews are acknowledging God as the ultimate creator and that whilst human beings are partners with God 
			in this creation, the act of creation is a gift from God and not an automatic right.
			<p>There are four general categories of work listed in the Torah which are prohibited on the Sabbath. 
			Talmudic scholars have expanded on these four basic categories by drawing up a list of thirty nine 
			prohibited categories. Directly tied to these prohibitions are utensils and objects which cannot be 
			handled on the Sabbath. Such objects are known as <b>"muktzeh"</b> which can literally be translated as 
			"that which is set aside".</p>
			<p>Considering the importance of ritualistic observance in Judaism it is not surprising to find that 
			Rabbinic scholars have written extensively about the types of activities which are forbidden on the 
			Sabbath, particularly in the light of the exponential technological changes that have taken place in 
			society, as the number of forbidden activities will continue to grow under the different existing 
			categories of prohibited activities.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Sabbath delight and honour</div>
			<div class="text">Even though ritual observance is of primary importance for Jews, this observance needs 
			to be accompanied by genuine delight in honouring and keeping the Sabbath. For example, the Prophet 
			Isaiah teaches "If thou turn away thy foot because of the Sabbath, from pursuing thy business on 
			my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, And the holy of the Lord honorable, And shall honor 
			it, not doing thy wonted ways, not pursuing the business, nor speaking thereof" (Isaiah 58:3).
			<p>This passage draws attention to two important underlying principles of Sabbath observance, 
			firstly the notion of Sabbath delight or <b>oneg Shabbat</b> and Sabbath honor, or <b>kavod Shabbat</b>.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Sabbath candles</div>
			<div class="text">There are various rituals associated with the Sabbath. Just before the 
			Sabbath is about to start the wife lights <b>two candles</b>. The first candle is meant to represent 
			the injunction to keep the Sabbath and the second candle represents the commandment to remember 
			the Sabbath. The wife then prays for the welfare of her husband and children over the lit candles. 
			A short synagogue service takes place at sunset to mark the beginning of the Sabbath.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Kiddush</div>
			<div class="text">The most important celebration that takes place on the Friday of the Sabbath is the 
			<b>Shabbat dinner</b>. This takes place at home with family and friends. The Shabbat table is laid with two 
			loaves, known as <b>"hallot"</b> which, like the candles, represent the dual Shabbat commandments to keep and 
			remember Sabbath, and cups, over which <b>Kiddush</b> is recited. The father blesses the children in order 
			of age, before Kiddush is recited over the wine, which "gladdens the heart" (Psalm 104:15).</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Synagogue attendance</div>
			<div class="text">On the following day, two meals are eaten, one following the morning synagogue service 
			and the second meal is eaten in the afternoon, generally with coffee and cake. The former meal is 
			preceded by Kiddush. Saturday morning is usually spent in <b>Torah study at the synagogue</b>. The 
			highlight of the service is the reading of a specified segment of the Torah.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Havdalah</div>
			<div class="text">The appearance of three stars in the darkened sky at sunset marks the end of the 
			Shabbat. At this point, <b>havdalah</b> is recited. Essentially, havdalah which means "division" is a 
			recitation which praises God for creating distinctions, between what is considered sacred and 
			what is not and between light and darkness for example. The braided havdalah candle is now lit, 
			as a sign that Shabbat has ended, hence lighting a fire is permissible again.</div>
