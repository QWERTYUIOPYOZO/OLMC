		<h1>Content Description </h1>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Covenant Promise</div>
			<div class="text">The origins of Judaism are traced back to significant figures known as <b>Patriarchs</b>. 
			The first of these is Abraham (Abram) who with his wife Sarah (Sarai) received the promise of God that 
			they would be the ancestors of descendents that would number as many as the stars in the sky (Genesis 15:5). 
			This promise, known as Covenant, expresses the commitment of God to the people known as the Hebrews or the 
			people of Israel. It is from this people that Judaism stems.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Abraham's background</div>
			<div class="text">The Patriarch Abraham was originally known as Abram. He lived a <b>semi nomadic life in 
			southern Mesopotamia</b> near the Euphrates River. He was the shepherd son of Terah and brother of Nahor and 
			Haran. In keeping with the customs of patriarchal societies of the ancient near east the names of female 
			family members were not recorded. Thus the names of Abraham's mother and any sisters are not known.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Abraham's 1st encounter with God</div>
			<div class="text">Abraham experienced the call of God in which he received the promise of being blessed and 
			becoming a <b>great nation</b>. He was also called to leave his own territory to move to the land that would be shown 
			to him by God (Genesis 12:1).</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Canaan - The Promise Land</div>
			<div class="text">According to the tradition of the Torah, Abraham and his family left the territory of "Ur 
			of the Chaldeans" (Genesis 11:31) and moved to the land of Canaan which is the modern day location of the state 
			of Israel. When he reached Canaan Abraham built an altar to God who had appeared to him.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">God's promise of descendants</div>
			<div class="text">Later, due to a famine Abraham and his family travelled to Egypt and then to Hebron. 
			In Hebron Abraham again experienced an encounter with God in which he received the promise of a great reward 
			(Genesis 15:1). During this encounter with God Abraham laments that his marriage to Sarah has not seen the birth 
			of any children and that he had no heir to inherit all that God had promised to him. It is here that God promises 
			that Abraham's <b>descendents would number as many as the stars in the sky</b> (Genesis 15:5).</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Ishmael</div>
			<div class="text">Despite this promise the continued childlessness of the marriage led Sarah to offer her 
			servant girl Hagar as a concubine to Abraham so that he could have a child. The result of this union was the 
			birth of Ishmael (Genesis 16:15). However, the relationship between Abraham and Hagar became a source of great 
			animosity between Hagar and Sarah.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Covenant of circumcision</div>
			<div class="text">After the birth of Ishmael God appeared once again to Abraham. This encounter with God led 
			to the Covenant known as the <b>Covenant of circumcision</b>. Abraham once again experienced God's promise that he 
			would be the ancestor of many and that his offspring would live in the land of Canaan.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Abraham's covenantal obligations</div>
			<div class="text">In this covenant Abraham is called to <b>walk in the presence of God and be blameless</b> 
			(Genesis 17:1). His name is also changed from Abram to Abraham and his wife's name is changed from Sarai to 
			Sarah. In Genesis verses 9-14 Abraham is commanded that he and his descendents must keep the Covenant with 
			God throughout the ages and that circumcision is to be the sign of this Covenant.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Isaac</div>
			<div class="text">In the context of this Covenant Abraham is told that he will indeed have his own son with Sarah, this 
			despite the fact that they are already of advanced years. The Covenant made with Abraham is to be passed on through his 
			son who is to be named Isaac.</p>
			<p>Despite the promise of the Covenant, considerable time passes before Sarah becomes pregnant and gives birth to 
			the son who is named Isaac. In keeping with the Covenant Isaac was circumcised when he was eight days old.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Sacrifice of Isaac</div>
			<div class="text">Later God calls Abraham to take his son Isaac to the land of Moriah and offer him as a 
			holocaust. The tradition shows that Abraham is obedient to God's call and takes his son to the place where 
			he is to be sacrificed. As they approach the designated place Isaac asks his father where the animal is for 
			the holocaust. Abraham replies saying "God will provide" (Genesis 22:8). Abraham continues with the preparations 
			to sacrifice Isaac until at the last moment an angel of God intervened and instructed Abraham not to sacrifice 
			Isaac.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Renewal of the promise of land and descendants</div>
			<div class="text">In response to Abraham's obedience the angel declares that because of Abraham's fidelity in 
			not withholding his son he would be blessed abundantly and that his <b>descendents</b> would be as numerous as the 
			stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore, that he would possess the <b>land</b> promised to him and that through 
			his descendents all the nations of the earth would find blessing (Genesis 22:15-18).</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Jacob</div>
			<div class="text">Following the death of Sarah in Hebron, Isaac married Rebekah. The tradition says that Abraham 
			died at the age of one hundred and seventy five years and was buried next to his wife Sarah.</p>
			<p>From the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah Jacob and Esau were born. Isaac and Jacob, along with Abraham are 
			known as the patriarchs of Judaism. Jacob was to be known as Israel, after he wrestled all night with an 
			angel - the name <b>Israel</b> means 'contender with God' (Genesis 32:29).</p>
			<p>Jacob had twelve sons who in turn became the ancestors of the <b>twelve tribes of Israel</b> (Genesis 35:16-27). 
			The youngest of the twelve sons is Joseph who ultimately becomes a chief advisor to the Pharaoh in Egypt and 
			whose story results in the Hebrews coming to reside in Egypt and is the precursor to the story of Moses and 
			the Exodus (Genesis 37-50).</p>
