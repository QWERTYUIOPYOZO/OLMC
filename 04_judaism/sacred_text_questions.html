	    <h1>Specimen Questions</h1>
	    <p><b> Evaluate the significance of Torah in the beliefs and practices of Judaism. </b></p>
	    <b> Explain the concept of Oral Torah and assess its significance for the practice of Judaism today.</b>
	    <h2>Sample responses </h2>
	    <p><b>Evaluate the significance of Torah in the beliefs and practices of Judaism.</b></p>
	    <p> The Torah is a term which customarily refers to the whole Hebrew Bible, which is also known as the Tenak. The Tenak is made up of three sections, Torah, Nevi'im and Ketuvim. The Torah is of critical significance to the beliefs and practices of Judaism as it is the most important portion of the Tenak because it records the covenantal relationship between God and the Hebrews which gives rise to the legal requirements which Jews should observe in order to stay faithful to the covenant.</p>
	    <p> The importance of the Torah in relation to the beliefs and practices of Judaism cannot be underestimated since it sets out the basic requirements necessary in order to keep the Covenant in the 613 mitzvot which forms the basis of all aspects of observance. This needs to be seen in light of the fact that Judaism is essentially a practical religion, where understanding of Torah is secondary to practise.</p>
	    <p> The second part of the Tenak is the Nevi'im. This section contains the writings of the Prophets, which plays a supporting role to the Torah in reminding Jewish people of their obligation to the Covenant. The third section of the Tenak, the Ketuvim, is a collection of books which are loosely referred to as Wisdom literature. This section plays an important role firstly, in relation to worship and prayer and secondly, in providing practical wisdom which is drawn from the core tenets of Judaism as expressed in the Torah. </p>
	    <p> The Hebrew Bible has a central role in the Jewish religion, and is undoubtedly significant in relation to the beliefs and practices of Judaism. The Tenak is normative for Jews in defining belief and in determining the ethical, legal, ritual and spiritual foundations of Judaism.</p>
	    <p> The Tenak is important principally through the foundational role of the Torah, which is the first section of the Tenak. The Torah has an important role in determining the beliefs and practices of Judaism because it contains the expression of the Covenant between God and the people of Israel and it sets out the law which Jewish people are obliged to follow in order to keep the Covenant.</p>
	    <p> The Covenant is significant because it marks the relationship between God and the people of Israel which is foundation and the cornerstone of Judaism. Subsequently, this covenant relationship gives rise to a set of laws which the Jewish people are obliged to follow in order to keep the Covenant. These laws are expressed in the 613 mitzvot which are contained in the Torah. Hence, the Torah is significant in the beliefs and practices of Judaism because all aspects of Jewish observance stem from and are related to the 613 mitzvot. Additionally, the Torah is important because it contains salvation history, which is the history of how the world was created and of God's relationship with humankind.</p>
	    <p> The Torah is highly significant in the beliefs and practices of Judaism, because Judaism is essentially a practical religion where theological understanding is secondary to practice and the 613 mitzvot contained in the Torah provide the basic religious instructions which guide Jews on a day to day basis. Hence, the study of the Torah is the highest mitzvot because it is through the Torah that Jews learn what is expected of them. Furthermore, the fact that the Torah provides religious instruction for the day to day life of a Jew is significant to the practice of Judaism because the Torah is a source of unity and a link to the Jewish heritage for Diaspora Jews.</p>
	    <p> The second section of the Tenak, the Nevi'im, also plays a significant role in the beliefs and practices of Judaism. The Nevi'im contains the writings of the Prophets. The role of the Prophet was essentially to remind people of their covenantal obligations when people departed from these obligations. The Prophets warned that such a departure had negative consequences, and that the people should repent and return to Covenant fidelity. In reprimanding the people over their infidelity to the Covenant, the Nevi'im in essence plays an important supporting role to the Torah.</p>
	    <p> The third section of the Tenak, the Ketuvim, which is the Hebrew word for "writings", is a collection of books which are loosely referred to as Wisdom literature. The most significant parts of the Ketuvim are the books of Psalms and Proverbs. The book of Psalms plays a significant role in Jewish worship and prayer because it contains a mix of hymns of praise and lament. The book of Proverbs is significant for the beliefs of Judaism in that they provide statements expressing practical wisdom related to prudent living. The Ketuvim, though important in its own right, is primarily significant because it plays a supplementary role to the Torah.</p>
	    <p> The Tenak is also significant in relation to the rituals and practices of Judaism. Firstly, the Tenak is an important text to study. Secondly, it contains prayers such as the Shema, which are central to the rituals and practices of Judaism. Thirdly, the Tenak has an important role in determining the rituals of Judaism associated with holy days such as Pesach and Yom Kippur. The Tenak also plays an important role in Jewish worship throughout the year. For example, there is a set cycle of readings whereby certain books are completed within the Jewish calendar.</p>
	    <p> The Tenak is undoubtedly of great important to the different groups of Judaism. There is a universal consensus amongst the Jewish groups that the Tenak is normative for Judaism and there is strong acceptance of the general principles established in the Tenak by the different strands of Judaism. What differs, however, is the application of the 613 mitzvot to their day to day life. For example, where Progressive Jews abide by the fundamental ethical principles of the Torah, they believe that the halakhic laws have the capacity to be reinterpreted in light of changing circumstances, to ensure that these laws remain applicable to contemporary society. In contrast, Orthodox Jews believe that the halakhah needs to be strictly applied.</p>
	    <p>The Torah is of critical importance to the beliefs and practices of Judaism because firstly, the Torah provides religious instruction for daily lives and secondly because the Torah is normative for Jews in defining belief and determining ethical, legal, ritual and spiritual foundations. The most important part of the Tenak is the Torah because it contains the expression of the Covenant between God and the people of Israel and it sets out the law which Jewish people are obliged to follow in order to keep the Covenant. The other sections of the Tenak, though important, essentially support the Torah which is the central element of the Hebrew Bible.</p>

	    <p> <b> Explain the concept of Oral Torah and assess its significance for the practice of Judaism today.</b></p>
	    <p><b> Introduction (152 words)</b></p>
	    <p> The Oral Torah is significant for the practice of Judaism today because this text, which interprets and applies the Torah to changing circumstances, shows what is required of the Jewish people on a day to day basis. The Oral Torah consists of two parts, the Mishnah and the Gemara, both of which interpret the broad principles contained in the Written Torah by formulating specific rules which show how these principles can be applied to a particular circumstance. These two parts were collected to form what is known as the Talmud.</p>
	    <p> Considering that understanding of the Torah is secondary to practice it can be clearly said that the Talmud is of great significance for the practice of Judaism today. However, whilst the Talmud is the focus of much study in Jewish communities, the Oral Torah is a supplement to the Written Torah, which is the primary document of Jewish sacred texts and writings.</p>
	    <p><b> Section 1 (150 words)</b></p>
	    <p> The Oral Torah is essentially the interpretation and application of the Torah to changing circumstances over successive generations. Explain the concept of the Oral Torah by showing why the Oral Torah is needed. State that in order for the general precepts of the Torah to remain applicable to every generation, these broad principles need to be applied in the light of changing circumstances. Thus, many Jewish scholars laboured meticulously over what the best application of the Torah would be through both studying the Torah and through oral discussion.</p>
	    <p><b> Section 2 (200 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Explain the concept of the Oral Torah by showing the history of how the Oral Torah developed. Begin by stating that the decisions of the early Jewish scholars were passed down in oral form. Explain why the Oral Torah came to be written down and what the product of writing these commentaries on the Torah were. That is, explain what the Mishnah and the Gemara are, and how they differ. Evaluate the importance of the Mishnah and Gemara, by weighing up the relative importance of the two collections to show that the Gemara is essentially a commentary on the Mishnah, which is the more important collection. These two collections came together to form the Talmud.</p>
	    <p><b> Section 3 (200 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Explain the concept of the Oral Torah by describing what the halakhah and the Haggadah are and differentiate between these two different types of subject matter. Assess the significance of the Halakhah and the Haggadah by comparing their relative importance. For example, state that while the Haggadah is important in providing wisdom and insight into principles of Jewish life, it does not have the prescriptive force of the legal requirements of Halakhah.</p>
	    <p><b> Section 4 (200 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Assess the significance of the Oral Torah for the practice of Judaism today by emphasising that the Oral Torah is important mainly because it provides religious instruction for the day to day life of Jewish people. Evaluate the importance of the Oral Torah in interpreting the broad principles of the Written Torah and how they apply to a particular circumstance by stressing the point that keeping the mitzvot is the primary aim of the Jewish life. Understanding the Torah is secondary to the application of the halakhic laws. Thus, the study of the Torah is the highest mitzvot because it is through the mitzvot that Jews learn what is required of them.</p>
	    <p><b> Section 5 (150 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Evaluate the significance of the Oral Torah for the practice of Judaism today by weighing up the importance of the different versions of the Talmud that is the Bavli and the Yerushalmi in relation to the community in which they are used. Link this to the concept of the Oral Torah by explaining the history which gave raise to the development of two different versions of the Talmud.</p>
	    <p><b> Section 6 (150 words)</b></p>
	    <p> Assess the significance of the Oral Torah for the practice of Judaism today by analysing how strictly the different groups within Judaism keep the halakhic requirements set down in the Oral Torah. Whilst acceptance of the essential principles contained in the Written Torah is almost universal across the spectrum of Jewish groups, the application of the Oral Torah that is the specifics of how the general principle can apply differs across the groups. Those at the conservative end of the spectrum believe that the Oral Torah is the perfect expression of God's will and hence cannot be changed. Those at the progressive end of the spectrum believe that the Oral Torah is cultural and historically laden and must be considered in the light of changing circumstances. Thus, they are more inclined to modify some requirements.</p>
	    <p><b> Section 7 (100 words) </b></p>
	    <p> While the Talmud is the focus of much study in Jewish communities, it is important to recognise that the Talmud is always at the service of the Written Torah. Evaluate the importance of the Oral Torah by weighing up the significance of the Oral Torah in relation to the Written Torah and show that the Talmud is of secondary and supplementary importance to the Written Torah.</p>
	    <p><b> Conclusion (137 words)</b></p>
	    In conclusion, the Oral Torah is significant because it reinterprets the broad concepts of the Written Torah in the light of changing circumstances so that it is able to be applied to new situations. In this way, the Oral Torah shows what is required of the Jewish people on a day to day basis. Whilst the different groups in Judaism adopt and apply the halakhic laws contained in the Oral Torah to varying degrees of strictness, they all acknowledge the importance of the Oral Torah in ensuring that the broad principles remain applicable today. However, it should be remembered that though the Oral Torah has been the subject of much study and concern in Jewish communities, it is still a supplement to the Written Torah. Nevertheless, the Oral Torah has a played a significant role for the practice of Judaism today. <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
