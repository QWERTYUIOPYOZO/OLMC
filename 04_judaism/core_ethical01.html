			<div class="footnote">613 mitzvot are foundational to Jewish ethics</div>
			<div class="text">The <b>fundamental source</b> of ethical guidance for Jews is the <b>Torah</b>, which includes the 
			Written and Oral Torah. Different components of the Torah give ethical guidance to varying degrees of 
			specificity. The <b>613 mitzvot</b> provide the broadest application of Jewish ethical principles. They are 
			regarded as the foundational element of Jewish ethics and underpin all other elements. The 613 mitzvot 
			can be further divided into two categories, positive mitzvot and negative mitzvot. <b>Positive mitzvot</b> 
			are commands to perform an act, for example to love one's neighbour. <b>Negative mitzvot</b> are commands 
			to refrain from doing something, for example do not murder.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Ten Commandments  as a summary of the 613 mitzvot </div>
			<div class="text">The <b>Ten Commandments</b>, also known as the Decalogue can be regarded as a <b>distillation of 
			the 613 mitzvot</b> as they contain the essence or the core of the more extensive catalogue of commandments.
			<p>The Ten Commandments are a foundational part of the Jewish ethical system which can be separated into 
			two groups. The first five commandments deal with the relationship between God and the people of Israel. 
			These commandments are formulated as positive, affirmative commandments. The next five commandments are 
			concerned with the relationship between individuals and their community. These commandments are framed 
			in terms of what one should not do, and hence are known as negative commandments.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Oral Torah</div>
			<div class="text">With the inevitable social change through the passage of time there came a need to reflect 
			on the meaning of the commandments in order that they be meaningfully observed in changing circumstances. 
			Thus the Rabbis have undertaken painstaking study in order to consider how the requirements of Torah are to 
			be applied.  These precepts must be considered and applied in the light of technological, economic, 
			scientific and sociological changes to ensure that they are observed in an appropriate manner by each 
			new generation of followers.
			<p>The Rabbinic study and discussion on the meaning and application of the principles of the Torah gave rise 
			to the <b>Oral Torah</b> which now forms an integral part of Jewish life.</p></div>
			</div>
			<div class="content2">
			<div class="footnote">Covenant </div>
			<div class="text">At the heart of Jewish observance and ethical conduct is the solemn relationship with 
			God expressed in the <b>Covenant</b>. It is through this Covenant that the people of Israel were protected, 
			sustained and nurtured. From the principles of this Covenant the people of Israel learnt their responsibilities 
			towards their God and towards other people. Thus the 613 mitzvot of the Torah are the fundamental guide of 
			appropriate ethical conduct.</div>
