	    <p> Christianity had a profound influence on early Australian society in the area of education. This is most evident in the development of religiously affiliated schools. This was because education was a critical issue for all religious groups but particularly for the Catholics many of whom belonged to the lower classes and hence belonged to a disadvantaged group in the colony. Consequently, education was seen by Catholics as a way to maintain their values, in the face of sectarian rivalry.</p>
	    <p> The influence of Christianity on education can be seen firstly with the enactment of the Schools Estates Corporation Charter of 1825. Its provisions were that one seventh of all colonial land grants were to be reserved for the Church of England schools and churches. The result was as intended, that is, it reaffirmed the status of the Church of England as the established church.</p>
	    <p> Governor Burke's Church Act of 1836 is the second example showing Christianity's profound influence on education. The Church Act provided a &ldquo;pound for pound&rdquo; subsidy to all denominations. Thus, on the surface, it appeared to equally assist all denominations but in practice the Church of England dominance continued. This was because the Church of England had the greatest capacity to raise money and hence obtained the greatest benefits from the provisions of the Act. The long term result was, however, unexpected. The Catholic Church through a great deal of determination, organisation, and sacrifice managed to take advantage of the provisions of the Church Act and turn it into an advantage for them. The Presbyterians were displeased with the fact that governments were funding denominational schools as they believed that state and church should be separate. The Methodists opposed the fact that the Catholics were receiving funding even though they were pleased to reap the benefits of the Church Act.</p>
	    <p> The end to funding for denominational schools came about through the Public Instruction Act 1880 which established that education was to be free, compulsory, and secular. This caused an abrupt end to state aid, that is, government funding for denominational schools. Most people belonging to the Church of England, supported government schools and as such were not concerned about the loss of funding to religiously affiliated schools. Those Church of England schools which did chose to remain operating as religious schools required that parents meet the cost of education themselves. The end to state aid brought great hardships to the Catholic school system because they did not have the same resources as the Church of England schools to continue operating. It was only through great sacrifice and dedication from those in religious orders that Catholic schools were able to continue to operate without government assistance.</p>
	    <p> It can be seen therefore through an analysis of three key pieces of legislation that Christianity has had a significant influence on education in colonial Australia.</p>

	    <p><b>6 marks</b></p>
	    <p> Christianity had a profound influence on Australia in the nineteenth century in relation to public morality. Public morality refers to the attempts made by the more conservative elements within Christian denominations to enforce certain moral values due to perceived immortality in society. Evangelical Protestants were generally more vocal than the Church of England and the Catholic Church in their opposition to perceived immorality in society. Thus they campaigned more strongly for legislation to enforce certain standards of morality in the colony.</p>
	    <p> The significance of Christianity with relation to public morality is clearly evident in three key debates: the push to encourage Sabbath observance, also known as Sabbatarianism, the issue of sexual morality and the temperance movement.</p>
	    <p> All Christian denominations encouraged Church attendance as it was thought to improve one's spiritual and moral character. The Evangelical Protestants in particular supported and encouraged strict Sabbath observance. The strong campaign for Sabbath observance resulted in legislation which banned recreational activities as well as servile and commercial labour on Sundays. Whilst theoretically Sabbatarianism was supported by all Christian denominations, in practice the Church of England and Catholic Church were less stringent in their views of Sabbath observance. This is because they saw no harm in recreational activities so long as it was not servile labour.</p>
	    <p> Christianity had a very significant and clearly identifiable effect concerning sexual morality. There was widespread opposition from all Christian denominations towards extramarital relationships, homosexuality, and divorce. With such unified religious opposition to these perceived instances of immorality it is not surprising that laws governing sexual morality were quite strict and divorce laws ensured that it was difficult to terminate a marriage in any circumstances.</p>
	    <p> The temperance movement was an attempt to reduce alcohol consumption. As a result of a campaign driven mostly by the Protestant denominations thousands of pledges were given by men to abstain from alcohol. Because of this success, attempts were made by Protestant denominations to seek legislation which prohibited the selling of alcohol. These attempts failed as they were not supported by a large portion of the Christian community, that is, it was not supported by the Church of England and the Catholic Church. These two denominations did not formally support the temperance movement or the attempts to legislate for the prohibition of alcohol. This was because they saw no harm in the moderate consumption of alcohol.</p>
	    <p> These public morality debates clearly indicate the significance of Christianity during the nineteenth century. These debates indicate not only the power Christianity held with regards to social control but also the significance of sectarian divisions in the colony. The public morality debates heightened the religious tensions which existed between the Church of England, the Catholic Church who were overrepresented in the lower classes and the conservative Protestant denominations in colonial Australia. The long term effects of the public morality debates were not intended by the Christian denominations. This was because these attempts at social control were generally viewed negatively by the broader community. The refusal by many to accept these attempts at social control laid the subsequent foundations for a more secular society.</p>

	    <p> The first Jews arrived in Australia as convicts on the First Fleet in 1788. In 1817, the first Minyan, that is, a quorum of ten Jewish men aged required for traditional communal worship was formed and a Chevra Kaddisha, which is a Jewish Burial society, was established. In the 1830s the first Jewish synagogue service took place in the home of Phillip Joseph Cohen. By 1838 the first official synagogue was consecrated in Bridge St, Sydney. 10 years later the first synagogue opened in Victoria. Meanwhile in 1844 in Sydney a larger synagogue was consecrated in York St. This synagogue was to serve as the centre of Jewish life in Sydney, until the Great Synagogue was built in Elizabeth St, Sydney in 1878. In 1845 the first synagogue was consecrated in Tasmania and in 1850 the first synagogue was consecrated in South Australia. During the 1850s the number of Jews in Victoria swelled from a few hundred to over three thousand as a result of the Gold Rush. In Western Australia no organised Jewish community developed until the end of the nineteenth century.</p>
