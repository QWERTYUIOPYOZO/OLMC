	    <h1>Content Description </h1>
	    <h2>The contribution of Christianity to social welfare in Australia pre - 1945</h2>
	    <div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Education for the needy</div>
		<div class="text">Christian groups in Australia have traditionally sought to assist the disadvantaged as 
		this is a central part of the <b>Christian ethos</b>. One way in which Christian groups have played an 
		important role in social welfare is by providing an education for the poor and the needy. In 1866 
		<b>Mother Mary MacKillop</b> and Father Julian Tennyson Woods founded the Order of St Joseph to teach the 
		children of the poor. After the introduction of the Public Instruction Act in 1880, the Catholic 
		education system  survived largely due of the dedication of those in religious orders.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Assistance for marginalised people  </div>
		<div class="text">In 1888, <b>Mother Esther</b> established the first Church of England religious order to work 
		for poor women and prostitutes. In 1897, Bishop Nathaniel Dawes founded the <b>Bush Brotherhoods</b> to provide 
		ministry for people in outback communities with preachers on horseback travelling around rural 
		communities. In the 1920s, the Australian Inland Mission of the Presbyterian Church developed the 
		<b>Flying Doctor Service and the School of the Air</b>.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Assistance for migrants</div>
		<div class="text">Migrants to Australia have always been among the most vulnerable and needy members 
		of the community. It was in response to needs in this area that <b>Caroline Chisholm</b> undertook her now 
		famous work. Arriving in Australia in 1838 Chisholm was concerned at the <b>plight of migrants</b>, 
		particularly young girls who were literally dumped on the docks with no means of supporting 
		themselves.
		<p>She began a tireless process of lobbying on behalf of the needs of migrants beginning with the 
		Christian clergy and extending her influence to the government as well.</p>
		<p>Through her influence the <b>Female Immigrants' Home</b> was established which ultimately provided 
		shelter and protection for hundreds of female migrants. Chisholm was also able to find secure 
		employment for many of these women.</p>
		<p>She returned to England in 1846 and began work to secure safe passage and support for families 
		migrating to Australia. In the course of this work she <b>assisted over 10,000 people</b> to migrate 
		and settle in Australia.</p>
		<p>Her work which continued until her death in England in 1877 earned her the title 
		of "<b>the immigrant's friend</b>".</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Great Depression</div>
		<div class="text">Whilst Christian groups have traditionally sought to provide aid and relief for the 
		needy the events of the <b>Great Depression</b> in the 1930s alerted Church groups to the fact that 
		<b>structural changes</b> were required in the way the State provided social welfare. The events of 
		the Depression indicated that aid drawn entirely from community support was insufficient in 
		dealing with the issue of poverty. As a direct result of Churches lobbying the government the 
		government introduced <b>unemployment benefits</b> known as the dole or "susso".</div>
