	    <h1>Content Description </h1>
	    <h2> Arrival and establishment of Christianity in Australia</h2>
	    <div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Arrival of the First Fleet</div>
		<div class="text">Christianity arrived in Australia in 1788 as part of the English penal colony of New 
		South Wales. Among the members of this First Fleet were English convicts, most of who belonged to the 
		<b>Church of England</b> and Irish convicts, most of whom were <b>Roman Catholic</b>. The officials in the party were 
		mostly English and the Church of England was regarded as the established religion in New South Wales. 
		<b>Rev Richard Johnson</b>, a Minister of the Church of England was the first Chaplain to the colony.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Sectarian division</div>
		<div class="text">The history of political and <b>religious division</b> between the English and Irish ensured that 
		<b>bitter rivalry</b> continued to affect the life of the colony. The deep religious division known as sectarianism 
		had raged since the days of the <b>reformation</b> in the 16th century and was strongly felt in the colony.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Sabbath observance</div>
		<div class="text">Life in the colony was harsh. Many of its inhabitants were unruly and harsh punishments were 
		commonly used to keep the convicts under control. Governor Philip had received the instructions to "ensure 
		<b>appropriate observance of religion</b>" in the colony and he fulfilled these instructions by insisting that all 
		people, regardless of their beliefs, would attend the <b>Church of England Divine Service</b>. This requirement 
		caused considerable resentment among the English, many of whom were not in the habit of attending Church and 
		even more so among the Irish who were being forced to worship in the Church which was not their own.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Relationship between religion, law, and punishment</div>
		<div class="text">The reputation of the Christian Church as part of the oppressive forces of government in the 
		colony was further enhanced by the fact that the Ministers of the Church of England also acted as <b>magistrates</b>, 
		sitting in judgement on the crimes of the colony. In this capacity, they regularly gave out <b>severe punishments</b>. 
		So much so that the second Chaplain to the colony, Rev Samuel Marsden, was known as the '<b>flogging parson</b>'.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Dominance of the Church of England </div>
		<div class="text">Gradually, various denominations of Christianity became established in the colony. 
		<b>The Church of England</b> as <b>the Established Church</b> was the largest and most influential. The Church of 
		England enjoyed the patronage of the governing authorities and was extremely influential in a wide range 
		of issues. <b>The Catholic Church</b> was the most troublesome, with its members being constantly in dispute 
		with the English authorities. Catholicism was not permitted to operate formally until 1820. Prior to that, 
		informally and with some occasional concessions, the Catholics maintained their faith with fierce loyalty. 
		In the early years of the colony, other denominations also established themselves and began to develop. 
		There were well established communities of <b>Methodists and Presbyterians</b> within a few decades of the colony's 
		beginnings.</div>
