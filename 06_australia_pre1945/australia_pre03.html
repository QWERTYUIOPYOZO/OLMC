	    <h2> Arrival and establishment of Islam in Australia</h2>
	    <div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Macassar</div>
		<div class="text">The numbers of Muslims in Australia according to the 2001 census was 281,572, which is 
		approximately 1.5% of the total Australian population. The first Muslims came into contact with the 
		Australian continent <b>prior to white settlement</b> in 1788. These visits, which began in the 1750s, were 
		from <b>Macassan fisherman</b> who came from what is known today as Indonesia. Their encounters with the 
		Australian Aborigines were generally friendly and peaceful. The introduction of the Immigration 
		Restriction Act 1901 and the establishment of territorial waters meant that these visits from Macassar 
		came to a total halt by 1907. Other Muslims from Indonesia were brought to Australia to work in the 
		<b>pearling industry and sugar plantations</b> during the late nineteenth century. The implementation of the 
		Immigration Restriction Act 1901, meant that many Muslims returned to their homelands.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Afghanistan and Pakistan</div>
		<div class="text">A few Muslims came to Australia as part of European settlement, either as convicts or 
		sailors. But it was not until the use of <b>camel transportation</b> in Australia that the numbers of Muslims in 
		Australia began to increase. Camel transportation was seen as an effective method of travelling the vast 
		desert areas of the Australian interior. From the 1860s onwards, Muslims came to Australia as camel drivers. 
		Most of these were from modern day <b>Pakistan and Afghanistan</b>. In 1882 the <b>first Islamic mosque</b> was built in 
		Maree, South Australia. In 1890 another mosque was built in Adelaide. During the 1880s and 1890s, Muslims 
		controlled and dominated the camel transportation business in NSW, Western Australia, South Australia, 
		Queensland, and Central Australia. During this period there were <b>approximately 3000 Muslims</b> who were 
		working as camel drivers across Australia. The 1920s saw the end of the camel transport industry which 
		meant that many Muslims had to leave Australia.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Turkey and Lebanon</div>
		<div class="text">The migration of Muslims from <b>Turkey and Lebanon</b> dates back to the nineteenth century, 
		however, these migrations occurred in relatively small numbers. <b>Muslims from Turkey</b> numbered approximately 
		300 by 1911. But following World War 1, where Australians fought against the Ottomans (Turks) the number 
		of Turkish born Muslims in Australia declined.</div>
