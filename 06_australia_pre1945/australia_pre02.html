	    <h2> Arrival and establishment of Judaism in Australia</h2>
		<p>Judaism, after Christianity, is the second religion to be established in Australia. Generally speaking, 
		the immigration of Jews was small before World War One. Even after World War One the percentage of Jews in 
		the Australian population has been quite small, around one percent, in fact.</p>
	    <div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Establishment of Judaism in NSW</div>
		<div class="text">The first Jews arrived in Australia in 1788, as convicts on the <b>First Fleet</b>. In 1817, the 
		first <b>minyan</b>, that is, a quorum of 10 Jewish men, was formed. The Jewish Burial society, Chevra Kaddisha, was 
		also established. The formation of a minyan and establishment of the Chevra Kaddisha are recognised as the 
		formal beginnings of a functioning Jewish community in New South Wales.
		<p>During the 1830s services were being held regularly in homes such as that of <b>Phillip Joseph Cohen</b> 
		who was also authorised to perform Jewish marriages. This is generally regarded as the first Jewish 
		synagogue. Critical to the acceptance of Cohen's community by the broader Australian community was the 
		fact that that they spoke English unlike most European Jews. In 1830 <b>Aaron Levy</b> became the first Rabbi 
		in Australia. In 1837 the first official synagogue was opened in <b>Bridge St, Sydney</b> with a capacity to seat 
		100 males and 30 females. In 1844, a permanent synagogue was consecrated in <b>York St, Sydney</b>. The York St 
		synagogue could hold 500 people and was to serve as the centre of Jewish life in Sydney until the <b>Great 
		Synagogue</b> was built in Elizabeth St in 1878 with Alexander Davis as the Chief Rabbi. By the late 1800s 
		there were synagogues in most major cities, however, over 40% of Jews lived in rural areas.</p></div>

		<div class="footnote">Establishment of Judaism in the different states of Australia</div>
		<div class="text">Judaism had been present in <b>Tasmania</b> since 1804 with the first synagogue consecrated 
		in 1845. Meanwhile, in Victoria, the first congregation was formed in 1843 with a synagogue opening five 
		years later. During the gold rush of the 1850s the number of Jews in <b>Victoria</b> swelled from a few hundred 
		to over 3000. Sporadic Jewish worship in South Australia began as early as 1844 with the first synagogue 
		consecrated in 1850. In <b>Western Australia</b> no organised Jewish community developed until the end of the 
		nineteenth century even though Jews had lived in Western Australia from 1829 onwards.</div>
