	    <h1>Content Description </h1>
	    <h2>The impact of sectarianism on the relationship among Christian denominations in Australia pre-1945</h2>
	    <div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Religious division</div>
		<div class="text">The term <b>sectarianism</b> refers to rivalry or division along religious lines. In many cases 
		sectarianism leads to severe <b>discrimination, persecution and violence</b>.
		<p>The conflict in Northern Ireland can be seen as sectarian rivalry between Catholics and Protestants. 
		The present conflict in Israel can be seen a sectarian rivalry between Jews (Israelis) and Muslims (Palestinians).</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Social, political and religious reasons</div>
		<div class="text">Often where there is a history of sectarian division, there are <b>social and political 
		reasons mixed with religious reasons</b>. It can be very difficult to separate one aspect from another. 
		In some cases, religious extremists claim they are acting from religious motivation when in fact 
		social and political reasons are clearly important factors.
		<p>At the time of the arrival of the first fleet (1788) there was considerable rivalry and bitterness 
		between the Church of England and Catholics in England and Ireland. This sectarianism stemmed from 
		two main sources.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Protestant Reformation</div>
		<div class="text">Firstly, the <b>Protestant reformation</b> of the 16th century had left a great deal of 
		bitterness between the Catholics and Protestants. Rivalry and mistrust had continued passionately in 
		the centuries that followed and by the end of the 18th century there was extreme division between 
		Protestants and Catholics in virtually all walks of life.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">English occupation of Ireland</div>
		<div class="text">Secondly, the <b>occupation of Ireland by the English</b> and the oppression of the Irish 
		people maintained the strength of feeling. The occupation of Ireland was more a political than religious 
		issue, however, religion featured strongly in the respective identities of the English and Irish. This 
		ensured that sectarianism would be part of the situation.
		<p>With the establishment of the colony in NSW, sectarianism continued to be a major issue. The colony was 
		set up with the Church of England as the established religion. The Catholics in the colony were a 
		small minority and felt they were harshly treated.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Forced religious practice</div>
		<div class="text">In the early years of the colony, it was expected that everybody attended Sunday 
		worship and that this was to be in the form of the <b>Church of England Divine Service</b>. The decision 
		not to allow Catholics to worship according to their own religion created further resentment. For 
		most of the first 30 years of the colony Catholics were not permitted to have a Priest minister to 
		their community.
		<p>The English authorities feared that granting permission for Catholics to worship together would 
		breed sedition as in evidence through the 1795 uprising in Ireland where the Catholic clergy had 
		taken key roles inciting the people to rebellion.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Castle Hill Rebellion</div>
		<div class="text">The fears of the authorities seemed to have been well founded when the <b>Castle Hill 
		rebellion took place in 1804</b>, just one year after the convict Priest James Dixon had been given 
		permission to minister to the Catholics of the colony.
		<p>The Irish (Catholics) were regarded as "scum" by most of the English authorities. They were portrayed 
		as <b>uneducated</b> as many refused to send their children to schools run by the Church of England. 
		They were accused of being <b>immoral</b> as many couples lived in de-facto relationships rather than 
		being married according to a rite of the Church of England. They were also regarded as <b>irreligious</b>
		as many refused to have their children baptised in the Church of England.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Education issue</div>
		<div class="text">Education became an important political issue which was played out according to 
		sectarian divisions. Catholics were determined to establish Catholic schools for their children. 
		Government decisions made it extremely difficult to maintain these schools. Catholics saw the <b>schools 
		as a kind of symbol of their freedom</b> and went to great lengths to ensure their continuation.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Employment practices</div>
		<div class="text">Sectarianism can also be seen in the types of employment practices which were 
		evident up until the early 1900's. Most businesses were owned and run by people of Protestant 
		background and many of these employers held deep feelings of <b>mistrust towards Catholics</b>. Accordingly 
		it was relatively common to see notices regarding positions vacant to include the qualification 
		"<b>Catholics need not apply</b>".
		<p>One of the few places where discrimination in employment was not practised was in the <strong>Public Service</strong>. 
		Consequently and not surprisingly, many Catholics were attracted to work in the public sector and 
		have traditionally been overrepresented in these jobs.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Public Service examination</div>
		<div class="text">With this in mind, Catholic schools had a strong focus on preparing their students 
		to pass the annual <b>Public Service examination</b> which would then provide them with <b>secure employment</b> 
		relatively free from sectarian discrimination.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Conscription debate</div>
		<div class="text">A further element which fuelled the sectarianism between Protestants and Catholics in Australia, 
		was the bitter debate over conscription in World War I. The government had <b>sought to introduce 
		conscription</b> to bolster the numbers of soldiers it could send to the front in support of Britain. 
		To do <b>this required the successful passage of a referendum</b> on the issue.
		<p>Leaders of the <b>Protestant Churches</b> and in particular the Church of England urged citizens to show 
		<b>loyalty to Britain</b> and support the referendum. <b>Catholic leaders</b> by contrast were <b>strident in their 
		opposition</b> to the idea of conscription.</p>
		<p>This opposition led to a great <b>escalation of hostility</b> towards Catholics who were considered as 
		traitors. The conscription issue went to two referenda. Both were defeated leaving a great feeling 
		of resentment towards Catholics who were vilified for their stance.</p>
		<p>Despite the strident, public opposition of Catholic leaders to conscription, it is evident, 
		nevertheless, that <b>many Protestants shared their opposition</b>. Catholics were barely 10% of the 
		population at the time and it would have taken a significant number of Protestants to also oppose 
		the issue for the referenda to be defeated.</p>
		<p>Later in the 20th century, in the aftermath of World War I & II and the Great Depression, 
		there was a considerable <b>softening of sectarian rivalry</b> which would ultimately give way to 
		<b>ecumenical cooperation</b>.</p></div>
