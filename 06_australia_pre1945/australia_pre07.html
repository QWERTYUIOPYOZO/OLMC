	    <h1>Content Description </h1>
	    <h2>Outline the contribution of ONE religious tradition in the provision of education in Australia prior to 1945</h2>
	    <div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Education was a critical issue for Catholics</div>
		<div class="text">Christianity had a significant impact on education in Australia prior to 1945. Education 
		was a <b>critical issue</b> for all religious groups but particularly for the <b>Catholics</b> who felt disadvantaged in 
		the colony. Partly because of this sectarian tension Catholics were keen to set up an educational system 
		which allowed them to maintain their values. The most significant effect of this was the development of 
		<b>religiously affiliated schools</b>.
		<p>The critical effect of Christianity on education up to 1945 can be seen by examining three key pieces 
		of legislation: Firstly, the Schools Estates Corporation Charter of 1825, secondly the Church Act of 
		1836 and thirdly the Public Instruction Act of 1880.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Schools Estates Corporation Charter 1825</div>
		<div class="text">The Schools Estates Corporation Charter of 1825 was instituted with the intent of providing 
		resources exclusively for Church of England schools and churches and thus reinforcing the Church of England 
		as the established Church. Its provisions were that <b>1/7 of all colonial land grants</b> were to be reserved for 
		<b>Church of England schools and churches</b>. The legislation achieved its purpose with the Church of England 
		obtaining large areas of land under the patronage of the colonial government. This was not well received by 
		other religious groups for various reasons. Chiefly they were concerned that the legislation made no 
		provision for their efforts in educating their children.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Church Act 1836</div>
		<div class="text">The next critical step in the way Christianity influenced education was with Governor 
		Burke's Church Act of 1836. The Church Act provided a <b>"pound for pound" (dollar for dollar) subsidy</b> for 
		all religious groups. This meant that for every pound raised by the denomination for its schools the 
		government would contribute the same amount in return. On the surface this appeared to equally assist 
		all denominations but in actuality the Church Act was put in place to continue the dominance held by the 
		Church of England because they had the greatest capacity to raise the money.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Effect of Church Act</div>
		<div class="text">The <b>immediate effects</b> were as intended: the Church of England gaining the greatest 
		benefit due to its greater capacity to raise funds from its communities. The <b>long-term result</b> of this 
		legislation was however, unexpected. This was because the Catholics through a great deal of determination, 
		organisation, and sacrifice managed to take advantage of the provisions of the Church Act.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Responses of different denominations to the Church Act</div>
		<div class="text">The <b>Presbyterian</b> Church opposed the Church Act because they felt that religion should be 
		separated from Government and following from this that religion should not be funded from public sources. 
		It held a concern that the receipt of government funding would lead to the government exercising undue 
		influence on Church matters. The <b>Methodists</b> were pleased with the introduction of the Church Act but due 
		to sectarian feelings were opposed to Catholics receiving funding. The other critical effect of the Church 
		Act was that it directly contributed to the <b>rural versus urban class divide</b>. These came about because 
		churches in rural areas, being smaller in number, were less able to raise such funds and subsequently 
		received fewer benefits.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Public Instruction Act 1880</div>
		<div class="text">An end to funding for denominational schools came about with the introduction of the Public 
		Instruction Act in 1880 by Premier Henry Parkes. Instead of denominational funding the Act provided for an 
		education which was <b>free, compulsory and secular</b> thus formalising public education. The Public Instruction 
		Act brought an abrupt end to funding for denominational schools. It brought about <b>great hardships</b> for 
		denominational schools to maintain their educational system. These hardships were particularly acute 
		for the Catholic Church because Catholics were over represented in the poorer classes which meant they 
		did not have the same resources as the Church of England to maintain their system of education. The 
		Catholic school system only survived as a result of the dedication from those in religious orders. 
		The absence of government funding for denominational schools continued to be a critical issue up to 
		and beyond 1945. Funding for denominational schools, that is, state aid continued to be an issue in 
		the early half of the twentieth century as evident in that the fact that it was an election drawcard 
		during the 1940s.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Effect of Public Instruction Act</div>
		<div class="text">The Church of England responded to the Public Instruction Act by continuing some 
		schools were the parents were able to meet the costs of education themselves. Generally, most people 
		belonging to the Church of England supported the public school system. The <b>Presbyterians</b> supported 
		the Public Instruction Act because they believed that religion and government should be separated, and 
		hence opposed governments having influence in religions by providing funding for religious schools.</div>
