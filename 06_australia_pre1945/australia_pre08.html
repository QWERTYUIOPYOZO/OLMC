	    <h1>Content Description </h1>
	    <h2>Examine the initiatives taken by one religious tradition in Australia in the area of public morality prior to 1945</h2>
	    <div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Definition of public morality</div>
		<div class="text">Public morality refers to the attempts made by the more <b>conservative elements within 
		Christian denominations</b> to enforce certain <b>moral values</b> through legislation. Public morality targeted 
		issues such as sabbatarianism, sexual morality, and the consumption of alcohol and gambling. Despite 
		the well intended attempts at social control public morality legislation was not always successful and 
		in fact it has contributed to society's ambivalent attitude towards religion.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Sabbatarianism</div>
		<div class="text">The fact that the colony was set up with the Church of England as the established 
		religion provided for the strong influence of the Church of England in the colony and the demand 
		for Sabbath observance is an indicator of this influence. The colonial government's requirement of 
		Sabbath observance was the <b>compulsory attendance of Church of England services</b> for all convicts 
		both English and Irish. The intention of this requirement was to seek too improve the <b>moral character</b> 
		of the convicts. The requirement of Sabbath observance was met which resistance from both English 
		and Irish convicts. The strong stance on Sabbath observance supported by the evangelical groups of 
		Christians resulted in legislation abolishing recreational activities along with  servile and commercial 
		labour on Sundays. In practice however, many people belonging to the Church of England and the 
		Catholic Church held more lenient views concerning recreational activities on the Sabbath while 
		opposing servile labour and commercial activities.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Sexual morality</div>
		<div class="text">Christianity had a very significant and clearly identifiable effect concerning 
		sexual morality. There was <b>widespread opposition from all Christian denominations</b> towards 
		extramarital relationships, homosexuality, and divorce. With such unified religious opposition 
		to these perceived instances of immorality it is not surprising that <b>laws governing sexual 
		morality were quite strict</b> and divorce laws ensured that it was difficult to terminate a marriage 
		in any circumstances.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Temperance movement </div>
		<div class="text">The <b>temperance movement</b> was mostly sponsored by the desire of Protestant denominations 
		who wished to reduce alcohol consumption. Some conservative elements among the Protestant groups believed 
		that total abstinence was necessary. The temperance movement called upon men to take a <b>pledge to abstain 
		from alcohol</b>. In order to promote this pledge of abstinence the sponsors of the temperance movement made 
		considerable use of women to convince their husbands, brothers and sons to take the pledge. Women were 
		often prepared to support the temperance movement as <b>women were most frequently the victims of alcohol 
		related problems</b>. The temperance movement had considerable influence on early Australian society. 
		Despite the influence of the temperance movement, legislation to prohibit the selling of liquor in 
		Australia was never achieved as the Church of England and Catholic Church authorities generally saw no 
		harm of the drinking alcohol in moderation.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Banning of gambling </div>
		<div class="text">Christianity was influential in the <b>banning of gambling</b> in early Australian society because 
		gain by methods other than honest labour was denounced by most Christian denominations. The Catholic Church, 
		however, did not hold any moral objections to gambling providing that it was not excessive.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">Overall effect of public morality legislation</div>
		<div class="text">In general these attempts at social control, often referred to as <b>wowserism, were viewed 
		negatively</b> and led to the gradual lessening of religious influence on society. Eventually the refusal 
		of the majority of Australians to accept social control by religious authority resulted in a more 
		secular society. The public morality debates also heightened the religious tensions between the 
		Church of England, the Catholic Church, and the conservative Protestant denominations in early 
		Australian society.</div>
