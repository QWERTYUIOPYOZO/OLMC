		<h3>The impact of sectarianism on the relationship among Christian denominations in Australia pre-1945</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>Sectarianism refers to rivalry or division along religious lines </li>
	      <li>Sectarianism leads to severe discrimination, persecution and violence </li>
	      <li>Social and political reasons mixed with religious reasons </li>
	      <li>At the time of the arrival of the first fleet (1788) there was considerable rivalry and bitterness between the Church of England and Catholics in England and Ireland . </li>
	      <li>The Protestant reformation of the 16 th century had left a great deal of bitterness between the Catholics and Protestants </li>
	      <li>Secondly, the occupation of Ireland by the English and the oppression of the Irish people maintained the strength of feeling </li>
	      <li>Colony was set up with the Church of England as the established religion Catholics in the colony were a small minority and felt they were harshly treated </li>
	      <li>Everybody expected to attend Divine Service </li>
	      <li>For most of the first 30 years of the colony Catholics were not permitted to have a Priest minister to their community </li>
	      <li>The Irish (Catholics) were regarded as "scum" by most of the English authorities </li>
	      <li>Education became an important political issue which was played out according to sectarian division </li>
	      <li>Employment practices were further instances of sectarianism. </li>
	      <li>Notices regarding positions vacant often included the qualification "Catholics need not apply". </li>
	      <li>Discrimination in employment was not practised in the Public Service </li>
	      <li>Catholic schools had a strong focus on preparing their students to pass the annual Public Service examination </li>
	      <li>Debate over conscription in World War I further fuelled sectarian rivalry. </li>
	      <li>To introduce conscription required a successful passage of a referendum on the issue </li>
	      <li>Leaders of the Protestant Churches urged citizens to show loyalty to Britain and support the referendum </li>
	      <li>Catholic leaders by contrast were strident in their opposition </li>
	      <li>Opposition led to a great escalation of hostility towards Catholics who were considered as traitors </li>
	      <li>A significant number of Protestants had to also oppose the issue for the referenda to be defeated </li>

		<h3>The are of public morality prior to 1945</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>Definition - Public morality refers to the attempts at social control through legislation, usually promoted by the more conservative Christian denominations, in response to perceived immoral behaviour in society.</li>
		  <li>Main Issues:</li>
		  <ol>
		    <li>Sabbatarianism (Sabbath Observance)</li>
			<ul>
			  <li>Intention:</li>
			  <li class="marker_off">To encourage Church attendance which Evangelical Protestants strongly supported because it was thought to improve one's moral and spiritual character.</li>
			  <li>Result:</li>
			  <li class="marker_off">Legislation brought in to abolish recreational activities, as well as servile and commercial labour on Sundays.</li>
			  <li class="marker_off">Church of England and Catholic Church were less stringent in their views as they saw no harm in recreational activities on the Sabbath, as long as it did not involve servile labour.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Sexual morality</li>
			<ul>
			  <li>Intention:</li>
			  <li class="marker_off">There was widespread opposition among all Christian denominations towards extramarital relationships, homosexuality, and divorce. Evangelical Protestants were particularly outspoken in their opposition to extramarital relationships, homosexuality, and divorce.</li>
		    </ul>
			<li>Temperance movement</li>
			<ul>
			  <li>Intention:</li>
			  <li class="marker_off">To overcome problems related to the drinking of alcohol by urging men to take a pledge to abstain from drinking alcohol.</li>
			  <li>Result:</li>
			  <li class="marker_off">Thousands of pledges were made from men to abstain from alcohol. Legislation to prohibit the selling alcohol was not achieved.</li>			  
			</ul>
			<li>Gambling</li>
			<ul>
			  <li>Intention:</li>
			  <li class="marker_off">Gambling was banned because gains by means other than honest labour was seen as corrupt</li>			  
			</ul>			
		  </ol>
		  <li>General result of public morality legislation</li>
		  <ul>
            <li>These attempts at social control, also known as wowserism, were generally viewed negatively by the broader community </li>
            <li>The refusal by many to accept these attempts at social control which curtailed many acts of enjoyment sowed the seeds for a more secular society</li>
            <li>These public morality debates also heightened the religious tensions which existed between the Church of England, the Catholic Church and the conservative elements within Protestant denominations in colonial Australia.</li>
