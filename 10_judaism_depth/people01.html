		      <p> Moshe ben Maimon was a Jewish physician, rabbi and
		        philosopher <b>born in Cordoba, Spain in 1136</b>. This famous
		        individual is more commonly referred to as Maimonides which literally
		        means son of Maimon in Greek. Others refer to this universally
		        famed figure in Jewish history as RaMBaM, an acronym for Rabbi Moshe
	          ben Maimon.</p>

            <div class="footnote"><p> Islamic world where Jews were considered as second class citizens </p></div>  
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>It is not the intent of this text to paint a comprehensive picture
		      of the early Medieval period. Rather it will focus on some of the
		        more important historical events and socio-political influences which
		        pertain more specifically to the life of Maimonides. In short, it should
		        be noted that <b>Maimonides </b>lived in an<b> Islamic </b>world
		      where Jews were regarded as <b>second class citizens</b>.		      </p>
		      <p> However, Islam was not the only threat to Judaism during this time. The early
  Medieval period also marks a revival of classical learning, especially a revival
  of Greek philosophy.</p>
<p> This age was characterised by the dominance of Islam in parts of Europe,
  the Middle East and the Near East. This powerful force that began in the Middle
  East in the 7th century had established an empire which extended from Northern
  Spain in the West to India in the East by the twelfth century.</p>
<p> Through their conquests, Muslims had access to Greek science and philosophy
  as well as Persian history and literature. With this wealth of both classical
  and contemporary learning the Muslims, who were great admirers of education,
  helped to disseminate knowledge of many new discoveries to the areas where
  Islamic civilisations existed.</p>
This diffusion of Islamic learning and culture throughout the medieval world
was further facilitated by the movement of European academics to Islamic countries
to study Islamic mathematics, medicine and philosophy. The result of this cultural
diffusion was the translation and preservation of the works of classical antiquity
in Europe. </div>
		  </div>
		  
		  <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p> Revival of classical philosophy posed as
                a threat to monotheism </p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>  The translation of Greek philosophy to Arabic by Arab and Syrian
		        scholars between the fifth and eleventh centuries, enabled the re-
		        emergence of Greek philosophy in Europe in the 11 th and 12 th centuries
		        CE. This revival of <b>classical philosophy</b>, especially
		        the writings of Aristotle, challenged the authority and validity of
		        many religious ideas In particular it posed a threat to the<b> monotheistic
	          religions</b> of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.</p>
		      <p> There were various philosophical challenges to Judaism but the major
		        philosophical concerns centered on concepts such as the Nature of God,
		        the existence of God, free will and the existence of evil. These perplexing
		        issues posed a threat to monotheistic religions because for monotheistic
		        religions their<b> faith in God </b>was not based so much
		        on <b>reason</b> as on<b> experience</b> - the
		        heart over the head, so to speak.</p>
		      <p> Thus the core belief of monotheistic religions was the belief in
		        one God, a God who had been revealed to human beings through the medium
		        of other human being such as Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad . The
		        revelation is also believed to come through other ways such as in creation,
		        in deliverance from enemies etc.</p>
		      <p> One Aristotelian idea which presented as a major problem for these
		        religions was the theory that the <b>prime mover</b>, the
		        first cause (God) was pure intellect. This view is linked to the principles
		        of Plato's Theory of Forms and to subsequent philosophers who
		        developed Plato's principles into what became known as <b>Neoplatonism</b>,
		        a theory which was developed by a philosopher by Plotinus.</p>
		      <p> The revival of classical philosophy was not the only threat which
		        faced Judaism during this time. Another significant threat came from
		        the fact that Jews lived in an Islamic world, where they were more
		        or less seen as second class citizens. That is not to say however that
		        the Muslims did not tolerate Judaism. In fact Muslims tolerated both
		        Judaism and Christianity in the countries they conquered mainly because
		        they, like Islam, were monotheistic religions and based their teachings
		        on the sacred scriptures. </p>
		      Muslims allowed Jews the freedom to practice their religion within
		      the Muslim empire but they had to pay special taxes and were considered
		      lower than Muslims in the eyes of the law. Thus, the need to preserve
		      and perpetuate the Jewish religion in an Islamic environment became a
	        primary concern for Maimonides.

            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>Despite the dominance of Islam in early Medieval Europe, the Jewish
		      culture flourished in Spain. In fact the period from 900-1200 CE
		        is frequently referred to as "The Golden Age of Spanish Jewry".
		        The Jews who lived in Spain were known as the <b>Sephardi Jews</b>,
		      a word which is derived from the Hebrew word "Sepharad" which
		      means " Spain". The other major community of Jews in Europe
		      was known as the <b>Ashkenazim</b>, a word which is derived
		      from the Hebrew word "Ashkenez" meaning "German".</p>
		      <p>One
		        of the critical differences between these two communities was
		        their attitude towards education. For the Sephardim, education was
		        based on a sound knowledge not only of the Torah but also of science
		        and philosophy. It was in this community, with its spirit of inclusive
		        education, that Maimonides grew up. It is to be expected therefore,
		        that his writings would be greatly influenced by his knowledge of philosophical
		        concepts. In contrast the Ashkenazim regarded education as being solely
		        directed towards knowledge of the Torah and Talmud. </p>

		        powerful and fanatical group of Muslims who, under their leader Aba
		        al-Mu'min,
		        invaded Spain in 1148. They claimed that they had discovered
		        a teaching of Muhammad which stated that Muslims were only to tolerate
		        Jews for five hundred years and if, at the end of that period of time,

		        His family came from a long line of judges and his father also followed

passed away. Maimonides' brother David became a dealer in precious stones
in order to support the family and to allow Maimonides', his prodigious
brother, to continue his studies. However, when David was lost at sea along with
a great deal of the family fortune, Maimonides had to earn a living and it is
thought that it was at this time that he started practicing medicine.</p>

		      <p>During these final years Maimonides, in addition to his devotion

		    <div class="text">
		      <p>Despite his amazing schedule and the demands on his time, Maimonides
		      was a prolific writer of important works in the fields of Jewish
		        law, medicine and philosophy. During his lifetime, Maimonides
		        wrote prolifically but his three best known works are:
		      </p>
		      <ol>
		        <li><b> Commentary on the Mishnah</b> (written in Arabic
                    in his youth) </li>

		        <li><b> Guide for the Perplexed</b> (written in Arabic
                      in old age) </li>
	          </ol>
		      Most of Maimonides' works were written in Arabic, the main
              exception being the Mishneh Torah which was written in Hebrew.
              In addition to his three best known works, Maimonides also composed
              various teshuvot (responsa), which is essentially a collection
              of correspondence between Maimonides' and various other Jewish
              authorities around that time. In addition to these texts, Maimonides
              also composed some medical texts, during his time as physician
              in the court of the Sultan. </div>

		      <p> In his capacity as a renowned Talmudist, Maimonides made three major
		        contributions to Jewish law: Commentary on the Mishnah, Sefer
		        HaMitzvot and with his 'magnum opus', the Mishneh Torah.
		        These works earned Maimonides' the reputation of being a highly

		    <div class="text">
		      <p> The Sefer HaMitzvot (The Book of the Commandments) is essentially
		        an introduction to his great work, the Mishneh Torah. The Sefer
		        HaMitzvot seeks to list the 613 commandments (mitzvot) found in the
		        Torah. Maimonides divides these 613 mitzvot into two categories: <b> positive
		        mitzvot</b> and <b>negative
		        mitzvot</b>. Positive mitzvot are commands to perform an act,
		        for example to love one's neighbour. Negative mitzvot are commands
	          to refrain from doing something, for example do not murder.</p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p>There are 248 positive or affirmative precepts and 365 negative
		      or prohibitory injunctions. But before Maimonides enumerates these
		      613 mitzvot, he gives an explanation of how he determined which
		        commandments were the 613 commandments, remembering that a simple
		        counting of Biblical mitzvot would yield a much greater number of commandments
		        than 613.</p>
		      <p>Maimonides sets out fourteen rules by which one comes to include
		        and exclude particular commandments to form the 613 commandments. </p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p> It is generally agreed that Maimonides' <b>greatest contribution
		          to Jewish life</b> was this code of law, the Mishneh Torah.
		          Maimonides' Mishneh Torah provided an exhaustive topical<b> codification
		          of the Talmud </b>which facilitated much quicker and easier
		          access to the<b> Jewish precepts</b><em>. </em>This work
		          comprised 14 books and was written in <b>Hebrew</b> in
	          a style which was easy to read and understand.</p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p> It seems that Maimonides' intention in compiling the Mishneh
		        Torah was to provide Jews with a comprehensible <b>guide to Jewish
		        Law </b>without having to spend long hours<b> studying the
		        Talmud</b>. By referring to the Torah and his code, Jews should
	          be able to work out how to behave in any given situation.</p>
		      Prior to Maimonides there was no systematic presentation of the
		      Jewish law (Torah and Talmud) thus a Talmudist would need to make
		      an exhaustive study of the entire text in order to explain the Talmudic
		      perspective on an issue. The Mishneh Torah was the result of ten
		      years of meticulous study.</div>

		      <p>In terms of the specific contents of the Mishneh Torah, the first book, the Book
of Knowledge (Sefer HaMada in Hebrew) contains laws concerning belief in God,
idolatry, repentance and the study of Torah. The other thirteen books detail
Jewish ritual and civil laws such as blessings, circumcision, holy days, relationships
between males and females, dietary laws and ethics.</p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p>The conclusion of the Mishneh Torah deals with Maimonides' interpretation
of the notion of the <b>Messiah</b>. Unlike some views of Messiah as
the one who would come and make Jews a dominant people over their enemies, Maimonides
saw the coming of the Messiah as a time of <b>peace and prosperity</b> in
which Jews would not have to worry about wars and oppression but would be free
to study the Torah and become familiar with the wisdom of the Law so that they
would be worthy of the life that was to come.</p>

		      <p> Maimonides was a much respected authority on Jewish law and religion,
		        even prior to his appointment as Chief Rabbi of the Egyptian

		      <p> Following the completion of his momentous work, the Mishneh Torah,
		        Maimonides set about to write his great philosophical tractate,
		        the Guide for the Perplexed (Moreh Nevuchim). This text essentially
		        deals with the key doctrines of Judaism from a philosophical standpoint.
		        For example, it deals with issues such as the nature of God,
		        what it means for God to be omnipotent, free will, what is evil and
	          what goodness means, justice and divine revelation.</p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p> Among the Sephardim there had been some previous interest in the<b> secular

		          with his<b> Guide for the Perplexed</b>. Among the Ashkenazim
		          there had not been any attempt to study anything beyond the
		          Torah, thus for the Ashkenazim, Maimonides' approach was radically
	          new.</p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p> Essentially, Maimonides was breaking down the tendency in the Jewish
		        tradition to separate the sacred and the secular in a way which compartmentalised
		        life by attending to the study of religious truths on the one hand
	          and the living of life in a secular community on the other.</p>
		      In doing so, what Maimonides tried to resolve genuine philosophical
		      concerns over some apparent contradictions in Jewish understanding.
		      Ideas such as the spiritual nature of God and the anthropomorphic depictions
		      of God in the Tenak were at the centre of these concerns.</div>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p>Maimonides succeeded in providing a clear and sound philosophical

			<div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote">
              <p>Contents of the Guide</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> In the first part of the Guide, for example, Maimonides deals with
		        the question of <b>anthropomorphisms</b> (describing God
		        in human terms). He criticised Jews who accepted literally such Biblical
		        expressions as "the finger of God". Although the Bible
		        described God in human terms, they were not supposed to be taken literally.
		        According to Maimonides, if taking the Bible literally contravened
		        reason, then it should not be taken literally. Religious belief should
	          be<b> logical </b>and<b> open to intellectual debate.</b></p>
		      <p> He also felt that one could acquire<b> knowledge of God through
		          the mind </b>and that studying the Torah helped Jews to attain
		          a greater knowledge of God in the philosophical sense. However, he
		          also stated that there was a <b>limit to the kind of knowledge
		          of God that a human could attain</b>. One could know what God
		          was like through God's actions and knowing what God was like
		          meant that one must then act as God did. For example, one could learn
		          that God was compassionate and therefore Jews must be compassionate.
		          They must "walk in God's ways".</p>
		      The Guide is also devoted to providing reasons for the commandments
		      in the Torah which may be seen as unreasonable such as the dietary laws
		      (<b>kashrut</b>). </div>

			<div class="content2"><h2>The Legacy of Maimonides</h2>
            <div class="footnote">
              <p>It is difficult to overestimate the significance of Maimonides</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>Maimonides died in Egypt in 1204 but his body was taken to Israel
		      for burial. His grave at Tiberius remains a <b>place of pilgrimage</b> for
		      Jews. The extent of the influence of Moses Maimonides on the Jewish
		      tradition can be readily seen through the esteem in which his teaching
		      is held in all strands of Judaism. In 1984 the Hasidic Rebbe Menachim
		      M. Schneerson proposed a widespread study of Maimonides' Mishneh
		      Torah in preparation for the 850 th anniversary of the birth of
		      Maimonides. The Rebbe's
		      call resulted in an overwhelming response of Jews from around the
		      world and across the spectrum of the Jewish tradition.</p>
		      <p>The biographers
		      of Maimonides have acclaimed his significance through their coining
		        of the saying "from
		      Moshe to Moshe there arose none like Moshe", thus giving voice
		      to their belief that Maimonides stands virtually without peer in
		      the Jewish world in terms of his impact, his significance and his recognition
		      among Jews. </p>
		    </div>
		    </div>
			
			<div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote">
              <p> Maimonides' major contributions</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> The momentous contribution of Moses Maimonides to Judaism can be
		      briefly summed up thus:
		      </p>
		      <ol>
		        <li>
		          <p> Maimonides sought to consolidate Jewish communities in the
                      face of the dual threats of persecution from Muslim communities
                      and challenges of classical philosophy by advising Jewish
		          communities on significant areas of controversy and with his literary
		          works. </p>
		        </li>
		        <li>
		          <p> Maimonides wrote the Commentary on the Mishnah and the Mishneh
                      Torah to facilitate the study of the Torah and Talmud among
                      Jewish communities thus strengthening these communities. </p>
		        </li>
		        <li>
		          <p> Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed addressed the
                        relationship between religion and philosophy to demonstrate
                        that Jewish beliefs had a sound basis in rational thought. </p>
		        </li>
		        <li>
		          <p> Maimonides developed the 13 Principles of the Jewish Faith
                      which would become the basis for many Jewish credal statements. </p>
		        </li>
	          </ol>
		      Surely therefore, it must be acknowledged that Maimonides' influence
              is virtually unparalleled in post biblical times. His influence
              embraces the great disciplines of religion, science and philosophy
              as well as providing Judaism with some its mostly highly regarded
              reference texts. Not all have embraced Maimonides' ideas
              however. Indeed he faced opposition from some of his contemporaries
              and continues to evoke criticism today. Yet despite these limitations,
              the extent of his impact is clearly remarkable as is summed up
              in the saying "from Moshe to Moshe there arose none like
              Moshe". </div>
