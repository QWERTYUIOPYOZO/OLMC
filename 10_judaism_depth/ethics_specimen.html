        of teaching in the area of environmental ethics which stretches back
        through more than three thousand years. The principal source of this

      <p> The Talmudic principle of bal tashkhit is fundamental to the understanding

        the Jewish world where environmental ethics are yet to be embraced in
        a serious and significant way.</p>
      <p> From the creation stories of the book of Genesis, Jews draw significant
        religious truths such as: that God is the creator of all things; that
        there is a close relationship between God and the created world; that
        the created world is a good thing; that human beings have a particular
        responsibility, known as stewardship, for the created world.</p>
      <p> One of the more significant verses in this section of the Tenak is
        Genesis 1:28 which includes the instructions to have dominion and to
        subdue the earth. It is these instructions which have, ironically, contributed
        to the historical exploitation of the environment with the understanding
        that humankind had been given license to freely use the world's
        resources.</p>
      <p> The commentaries on this text in the Oral Torah clearly challenge the
        view that humankind has been given some sort of divine sanction to selfishly
        exploit the world's resources. Contemporary interpretations of
        this text highlight the mutual relationship which exists between humankind
        and the rest of creation. The world provides resources needed for human
        life, however, the negligent use of these resources will lead to environmental
        degradation and a loss of the capacity of the earth to provide. Thus
        this passage forms part of the teaching on stewardship in the Jewish
        tradition.</p>

        where environmental ethics are yet to be embraced in a serious and significant
        way.</p>
      <p> Jews draw significant religious truths from the biblical creation stories.
        These truths lead to a body of teaching which forbids unnecessary destruction,
        waste and excessive use of resources. Among these religious truths are
        beliefs such as: that God is the creator of all things; that there is
        a close relationship between God and the created world; that the created
        world is a good thing; that human beings have a particular responsibility,
        known as stewardship, for the created world.</p>

      <p> Bal tashkhit is the principle which effectively underpins all Jewish
        environmental ethics. It leads to an understanding which avoids needless
        destruction, waste and excessive use of the world's resources.        </p>

      <h2>Sample Responses<b> </b></h2>
      <p><b>Question 5 - Judaism (20 marks)</b></p>
      <p><b>Describe and explain Jewish ethical teachings on ONE of the following: </b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>bioethics</strong></li>
        <li><strong>environmental ethics </strong></li>
        <li><strong>sexual ethics</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p> The religious tradition of Judaism has a rich and profound tradition
        of teaching in the area of environmental ethics which stretches back
        through more than three thousand years. The principal source of this
        teaching is of course the Torah which is in turn supported by many detailed
        explanations and applications of Torah found in the tradition of the
        Oral Torah.</p>
      <p> Despite the richness of the teaching on environmental ethics, Judaism
        does not have a strong history of activism in this area. Like other religious
        traditions, Judaism has only recently developed a response to the modern
        environmental crisis. It has only been in recent decades that Jewish
        scholars and activists have begun to draw from the ancient teaching of
        Judaism and represent it with a sharper and more urgent focus. Even today,
        with a renewed focus on ecology, there are many instances throughout
        the Jewish world where environmental ethics are yet to be embraced in
        a serious and significant way.</p>
      <p> The first example of teaching on environmental ethics is encountered
        in the Tenak in the creation stories of Genesis 1-2. These stories convey
        a number of important insights concerning creation and the relationships
        and responsibilities that exist between God, humankind and the rest of
        the created order.</p>
      <p> From these chapters of Genesis, Jews draw significant religious truths
        such as: that God is the creator of all things; that there is a close
        relationship between God and the created world; that the created world
        is a good thing; that human beings have a particular responsibility,
        known as stewardship, for the created world and that failure to fulfill
        this responsibility of stewardship will inevitably lead to undesirable
        consequences for humankind.</p>
      <p> One of the more significant verses in this section of the Tenak is
        Genesis 1:28 which includes the instructions to have dominion and to
        subdue the earth. It is these instructions which have, ironically, contributed
        to the historical exploitation of the environment with the understanding
        that humankind had been given license to freely use the world's
        resources.</p>
      <p> The commentaries on this text in the Oral Torah clearly challenge the
        view that humankind has been given some sort of divine sanction to selfishly
        exploit the world's resources. Contemporary interpretations of
        this text highlight the mutual relationship which exists between humankind
        and the rest of creation. The world provides resources needed for human
        life, however, the negligent use of these resources will lead to environmental
        degradation and a loss of the capacity of the earth to provide. Thus
        this passage forms part of the teaching on stewardship in the Jewish
        tradition.</p>
      <p> Jews are taught that they have a fundamental responsibility to care
        for creation. In this sense they are God's partners in creation
        and are responsible for ensuring that it is nurtured and cared for in
        sustainable ways. The Jewish understanding of stewardship guards against
        selfish or careless exploitation of the world's resources.</p>
      <p> Another passage from Genesis speaks of God placing humankind in the
        garden and instructing them to till it and guard it. This is one of many
        examples in the Tenak where instructions are given regarding the responsible
        use of the land for agriculture. These instructions from Genesis 2:15
        are further aspects highlighting the Jewish understanding of stewardship.
        The earth's resources will provide for human need, however, humankind
        has a responsibility to protect environment and ensure it remains fruitful.</p>
      <p> The Torah requires responsible agricultural practices whereby the fields
        are to lie fallow every seventh year in order to ensure the continued
        fertility of the soil and to guard against over taxing its resources.</p>
      <p> Deuteronomy 20:19-20 includes instructions about the conduct of a siege
        in the context of war. It prohibits the wanton destruction of the crops
        of the besieged city. In presenting this prohibition, the text highlights
        the wrong involved in any needless destruction of the natural environment.
        This passage is the foundation for the Talmudic principle of bal tashkhit
        which is fundamental to the understanding of Jewish environmental ethics.</p>
      <p> While the specific reference in the passage from Deuteronomy is to
        the conduct of a siege in a time of war, the Rabbis saw a clear parallel
        to the situation of any unnecessary environmental destruction and have
        extended the meaning of the text to cover all such situations.</p>
      <p> The principle of bal tashkhit is not only fundamental to Jewish environmental
        ethics but is essentially a paradigm for Jewish ethics as a whole. Bal
        tashkhit means do not destroy. Beyond its original biblical context it
        has been used to prohibit any form of needless or careless destruction,
        waste or excessive use of resources.</p>
      <p> In the buildings of towns and cities, the Torah requires that sufficient
        space is left surrounding the urban area for agricultural purposes. This
        requirement in Numbers 35:3-5 ensures that there is not an overpopulation
        of a particular region through urban sprawl and that there is sufficient
        undeveloped land to provide a rural buffer between towns.</p>
      <p> Further teachings prevent hunters from killing the adult and its offspring
        on the same day preventing the destruction of a species which would result
        if a generation was not able to reproduce. There are also provisions
        in a number of texts for animals to be given the same Sabbath rest as
        humans enjoy.</p>
      <p> Texts anticipating future messianic times also convey some important
        environmental themes. These visions show a flourishing environment and
        a state of harmony between humankind and the rest of creation. They reflect
        beliefs of a future time where people will live according to the will
        of God. It is important to note that environmental wellbeing is integral
        to this vision.</p>
      <p> Two other elements of ecology are also found in the Tenak. The first
        is a reverence and respect for creation which is espoused in the Psalms
        and secondly there is a sober assessment of the relative insignificance
        of humanity in the light of the wonders of creation found in the book
        of Job.</p>
      <p> Both these examples challenge an anthropocentric view which exalts
        humankind over the rest of creation and which leads inevitably to its
        exploitation.</p>
      <p> While Judaism does not regard humankind as the same as the rest of
        creation, it nevertheless, opposes a view which allows humankind to be
        exalted over creation.</p>
      <p> The tradition of the Oral Torah is profoundly significant in understanding
        the Jewish approach to environmental ethics. The discussions of the Rabbis
        have led to important applications of the principles set down in the
        Torah and provide clear guidance to the Jewish communities in terms of
        their relationship to the environment and their responsibility to protect
        it.</p>
      <p> The ideas expressed in the teaching of the Rabbis are direct developments
        from the ancient principles expressed in the Torah and provide a more
        detailed analysis of the issue.</p>
      <p> Across the spectrum of Judaism today the greatest activity in the field
        of environmental ethics has come from those belonging to the progressive
        strands such as Reform and Liberal Judaism.</p>
      <p> Among the Orthodox Jewish communities there is less emphasis given
        to environmental ethics, as indeed is the case with a range of social
        issues. Given the richness of environmental teaching found in the Torah
        and Talmud, it cannot be said that Orthodox Judaism is unconcerned by
        environmental considerations. However, there is less evidence of environmental
        activism in the Orthodox strands of Judaism in comparison to those at
        the progressive end of the spectrum.</p>
      <p> While the Jewish biblical tradition provides significant guidance in
        the field of environmental ethics, it has to be said that until recent
        times there has been little done by the Jewish communities in the field
        of environmental ethics.</p>
      <p> There have always been individual and communities within the Jewish
        tradition who have provided examples of leadership in this field, however,
        it has not been a prominent concern for Jews overall.</p>
      <p> While most Jewish communities tacitly recognise the importance of environmental
        ethics, it is yet to become a major focus of day to day life for most
        Jews and their local communities. </p>
