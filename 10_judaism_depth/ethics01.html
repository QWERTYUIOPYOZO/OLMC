		<h2> Environmental Ethics in Jewish History</h2>
		
			<div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p>Biblical and Rabbinic teaching</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>The religious tradition of Judaism has a <b>long and rich tradition</b> of
		      environmental ethics which is found scattered through three thousand
		      years of biblical and rabbinic teaching.		      </p>
		      <p> Despite the extent of the tradition of environmental ethics,
                Judaism has lacked a clear and prominent response to ecological
                issues. It has only been in the <b>last few decades</b> that
                environmental ethics have become a <b>significant focus</b> of
                Jewish thought and even then, it is yet to filter down to many
                local communities.</p>
              The reality is that the Jewish teaching on the environment is a
              rich but largely <b>untapped source of guidance</b>.
              It has been allowed to lie dormant possibly because Jewish communities
              felt they were dealing with more urgent matters or perhaps because
              Jews were by and large unaware of the seriousness of the environmental
              crisis until recent times.</div>
		  </div>
		  
		  <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p>Parallels social movement of ecology</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> The development of a <b>modern movement</b> of environmental
	          ethics within Judaism has largely paralleled the broader <b>social
	          movement</b> of concern for the environment. In the light of
	          this movement, many Jewish writers have begun to rediscover the
	          traditional teaching and bring it into <b>sharper focus</b> in
	          the light of the ecological crisis.</p>
	          <p>The fact that environmental awareness
	            is for most a fairly recent phenomena is due in part to the fact
	            that <b>pre-industrialised societies</b> simply
  did not have the capacity to achieve environmental degradation at the rate
	            and to the extent that modern societies do. Consequently, while
	            there has always been a rich tradition of environmental ethics in
	            Judaism, there has only recently been an urgent need to bring it
	            to the fore. </p>

            <div class="footnote"><p>Genesis 1:28</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>One of the difficulties encountered in Jewish environmental ethics
		        is the meaning of the biblical command to <b>subdue and have dominion
		        over the earth</b> (Genesis
1:28). This has led some Jews to regard the earth as the possession of humankind
and provided a <b>tacit endorsement</b> for it to be exploited.</p>

            <div class="footnote"><p>Simcha Bunam</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> In the 18th century the <b>Hasidic Rebbe</b> Simcha Bunam
		        instructed his followers to "keep two truths in your pocket
		        and take them out according to the need of the moment. Let one
		        be "For
		        my sake the world was created." And the other: "I am dust
		        and ashes." This statement <b>highlights the tension</b> that
		        has existed between the ideas of humankind being given dominion
		        over the rest of creation and that of its responsibility to care
		        for creation.</p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p>The great <b>Rabbinic scholar</b> Rashi spoke of this dominion
		        as something that is only relevant when enacted with the appropriate <b>standards
		        of responsibility</b>. "When humanity is worthy, we have
		        dominion over the animal kingdom; when we are not, we descend below
	          the level of animals and the animals rule over us."</p>

		  <h2>Biblical Reflections on Environment</h2>
		  
		  <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p>Tenak and Talmud</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>Jewish writings have a number of <b>ecological themes</b>,
              many are taken from the <b>Tenak</b>. There are also<b> specific
              teachings</b> on environment to be found in the <b>Talmud. </b></p>
              <p>The first example encountered in the Tenak is that of the creation
                stories of <b>Genesis
  1-2</b>. These stories provide the biblical accounts of creation and convey
  a number of <b>important insights</b> concerning creation and the
  relationships and responsibilities that exist between God, humankind and the
  rest of the created order.</p>
		    </div>
		  </div>
		  
		  <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p>Religious truths</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> From these chapters of Genesis, Jews draw significant religious truths
		        such as: that God is the <b>creator</b> of all things; that
		        there is a close <b>relationship</b> between God and the
		        created world; that the created world is a <b>good thing</b>;
		        that human beings have a particular responsibility, known as <b>stewardship</b>,
		        for the created world and that failure to fulfill this responsibility
		        of stewardship will inevitably lead to undesirable <b>consequences</b> for
	          humankind.</p>
            </div>
		  </div>
		  
		  <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p>Genesis 1:28</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>One of the more significant verses in this section of the Tenak
              is Genesis 1:28 which includes the instructions to have <b>dominion
              and to subdue the earth</b>. It is these instructions which
              have contributed to the <b>historical exploitation</b> of
              the environment with the understanding that humankind had been
              given license to freely use the world's resources.</p>
              <p>The commentaries
              on this text in the Oral Torah clearly challenge the view that
              humankind has been given some sort of divine sanction to selfishly
            exploit the world's resources. </p>
		    </div>
		  </div>
		  
		  <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p>Stewardship</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> Contemporary interpretations of this text highlight the <b>mutual
		          relationship</b> which exists between humankind and the rest
		          of creation. The world provides resources needed for human
		          life, however, the negligent use of these resources will lead to <b>environmental
		          degradation</b> and a loss of the capacity of the earth to provide.
		          Thus this passage forms part of the teaching on stewardship
		          in the Jewish tradition. Jews are taught that they have a <b>fundamental
		          responsibility</b> to care for creation. In this sense they
		          are God's partners in creation and are responsible for ensuring
		          that it is nurtured and cared for in sustainable ways. The
		          Jewish understanding of stewardship guards against selfish or careless
	          exploitation of the world's resources.</p>

            <div class="footnote"><p>Genesis 2:15</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>Another passage from Genesis speaks of God placing humankind in the
		        garden and instructing them to till it and guard it. This is one of
		        many examples in the Tenak where instructions are given regarding the
		        responsible use of the land for agriculture. These instructions from
		        Genesis 2:15 are further aspects highlighting the Jewish understanding
		        of <b>stewardship</b>. The earth's resources
will provide for human need, however, humankind has a responsibility to <b>protect
environment and ensure it remains fruitful.</b></p>
            </div>

            <div class="footnote"><p>Leviticus 25:5-6</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> The Torah requires <b>responsible agricultural practices</b> whereby
		        the fields are to <b>lie fallow</b> every seventh year in
		        order to ensure the continued fertility of the soil and to guard
	          against over taxing its resources (Leviticus 25:5-6)</p>

            <div class="footnote"><p>Messianic prophecy</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>Texts anticipating future messianic times also convey some important
		        environmental themes. Prophecies such as those found in <b>Isaiah
		        11:1-9 and Joel 2:21-26</b> show
a <b>flourishing environment</b> and a state of <b>harmony</b> between
humankind and the rest of creation. These messianic visions reflect beliefs of
a future time where people will live according to the will of God. It is important
to note that environmental wellbeing is integral to this vision.</p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p> Deuteronomy 20:19-20 includes instructions about the conduct of a
		        siege in the context of war. It prohibits the wanton destruction of
		        the crops of the besieged city. In presenting this prohibition, the
		        text highlights the wrong involved in any <b>needless destruction</b> of
		        the natural environment. This passage is the foundation for the Talmudic
		        principle of bal tashkhit which is fundamental to the understanding
	          of Jewish environmental ethics.</p>
              While the specific reference in the passage from Deuteronomy is
              to the conduct of a siege in a time of war, the Rabbis saw a clear
              parallel to the situation of any <b>unnecessary environmental
              destruction</b> and have extended the meaning of the text
            to cover all such situations. </div>

            <div class="footnote"><p>Numbers 35:3-5</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>In the buildings of towns and cities, the Torah requires that <b>sufficient
space</b> is left surrounding the urban area for agricultural purposes.
This requirement in Numbers 35:3-5 ensures that there is not an overpopulation
of a particular region through <b>urban sprawl</b> and that there is
sufficient undeveloped land to provide a rural buffer between towns.</p>

		      <p> Further teachings prevent hunters from killing the <b>adult
		          and its offspring</b> on the same day (Deuteronomy 22:6-7 &amp; Leviticus

		          of a species</b> which would result if a generation was not
		          able to reproduce. There are also provisions in a number of
		          texts for animals to be given the same <b>Sabbath rest</b> as
	          humans enjoy. (Exodus 20:11, Exodus 23:12, Deuteronomy 5:14).</p>

		      <p>Two other elements of ecology are also found in the Tenak. The
              first is a <b>reverence and respect for creation</b> which

              of the relative <b>insignificance of humanity</b> in
              the light of the wonders of creation found in the book of Job 39-41.              </p>
              <p> Both these examples challenge an <b>anthropocentric view</b> which
  exalts humankind over the rest of creation and which leads inevitably to its

While Judaism does not regard humankind as the same as the rest of creation - humankind
is regarded as distinct from the rest of creation because of its <b>self

		  <h2>Environmental Ethics in the Oral Torah</h2>
		  
		   <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

		      <p> The discussions of the Rabbis have led to important applications
		        of the principles set down in the Torah and provide <b>clear guidance</b> to
		        the Jewish communities in terms of their <b>relationship</b> to
		        the environment and their <b>responsibility</b> to protect
	          it.</p>
              The ideas expressed in the teaching of the Rabbis are direct developments
              from the <b>ancient principles</b> expressed in the Torah
            and provide a more <b>detailed analysis</b> of the issue.</div>

            <div class="footnote"><p>Bal tashkhit</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>The <b>fundamental law</b> of bal tashkhit underpins
              the teaching of the Jewish tradition on the environment. It is
              based on the passage from Deuteronomy which <b>prohibits wanton
              destruction</b> of crops etc during the siege of a city. (Deuteronomy
              20:19).              </p>
              <p> The principle of bal tashkhit is not only fundamental to Jewish environmental
  ethics but is essentially a <b>paradigm for Jewish ethics</b> as
  a whole. Bal tashkhit means do not destroy. Beyond its original biblical context
  it has been used to prohibit any form of <b>needless or careless destruction,
  waste or excessive use of resources</b>. </p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p>In its original form, <b>bal tashkhit</b> prohibits the
              destruction of fruit trees. Others may be cut down but fruit trees
              must be preserved for the food they provide. The Talmud extends
              this specific teaching to a <b>range of applications</b>. "Whoever
              breaks vessels, or tears garments, or destroys a building, or clogs
              a well, or does away with food in a destructive manner violates
              the negative mitzvah of bal tashkhit"<em> (</em> Kiddushin<em> 32a)</em></p>
              <p>The
              Talmud also uses the principle of bal tashkhit to prohibit the <b>unnecessary
slaughter of animals</b> and the wasting of fuel. There is also a suggestion
that <b>extravagant eating</b> when plainer options are available is
a violation of bal tashkhit (Shabbat 140b). Further actions prohibited by the
principle of bal tashkhit include the <b>diverting of water</b> supplies
from people or from their crops. </p>

		      <p>The great Jewish scholar <b>Moses Maimonides</b> also
              taught that a person should be particular about not being <b>extravagant
              or unnecessarily wasteful</b>. Maimonides taught that to bury
              a person in good or expensive garments rather than providing for
              the needs of the poor violated the principle of bal tashkhit. (Mishneh
              Torah, Mourning 14:24).              </p>
              <p> Maimonides also qualifies the application of bal tashkhit by ruling that
  it is <b>lawful</b> to cut down fruit trees in <b>certain circumstances</b> such
  as when it may be harming more valuable crops or damaging the property of another.
  He notes that the Torah prohibits only <b>unnecessary destruction</b> (Mishneh
  Torah, Law of Kings 6:8-9).</p>
Other aspects of the Oral Torah remind the Jewish people of their responsibility
for <b>care for the environment</b>. The Talmud includes the following
famous reflection on the creation stories of Genesis. </div>

<p><b> Maimonides</b> affirms this notion saying that: "This

The Jewish tradition also teaches against the kind of <b>greed and desire</b> which

		    <div class="text">
		      <p>The recognition of the <b>fragility of the environment</b> and
		        the limited extent of the world's resources is a relatively <b>recent
development</b>. Furthermore <b>pre industrialised</b> societies
have had a far <b>lesser impact</b> on the environment than that of
modern communities. It is understandable, therefore, that throughout the history
of Judaism people were <b>largely unaware</b> of the urgency of their
responsibilities towards the environment. Indeed, the focus had frequently been
on the ability and capacity of humankind to harness the world's resources
in more sophisticated and efficient way.</p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p> Jewish teaching saw that it was important for human beings to
                fully utilise the gifts and talents provided by their creator
                and that to use their intelligence and ingenuity to exploit the
                world's
              resources. Such ideas stemmed from the teaching of the Torah to <b>subdue
              and have dominion over creation</b>. In this context control
              of the natural environment could be seen as a <b>form of worship
              of the creator.</b></p>
              <p>While such thinking may seem abhorrent
              to modern Jews, it needs to be recognised that such ideas were
              developed in the absence of any understanding about the potential
          of humankind to seriously damage and/or destroy the natural world. </p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p>With the <b>increasing social awareness of ecology</b>,
              Jewish teachers have presented important insights into environmental
              ethics which are not only <b>informing the understanding</b> of
              Jewish adherents but are also <b>contributing to dialogues</b> with
              scientists, economists and politicians throughout the world</p>
              <p>While
                these thinkers have made enormous contributions to environmental
            awareness environmental ethics remains a side issue for many Jews. </p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p>Across the spectrum of Judaism the greatest activity in the field
              of environmental ethics has come from those belonging to the <b>progressive
              strands</b> such as Reform and Liberal Judaism.</p>
              <p>Among the <b>Orthodox</b> Jewish
                communities there is <b>less emphasis</b> given to
                environmental ethics, as indeed is the case with a range of social
                issues. Given the richness of environmental teaching found in
                the Torah and Talmud, it cannot be said that Orthodox Judaism
                is unconcerned by environmental considerations. However, there
                is <b>less evidence of environmental
                activism</b> in the Orthodox strands of Judaism in comparison
            to those at the progressive end of the spectrum. </p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p>While the Jewish <b>biblical tradition</b> provides significant
              guidance in the field of environmental ethics, it has to be said
              that until recent times there has been little done by the Jewish
              communities in the field of environmental ethics.              </p>
              <p> There have always been <b>individual and communities</b> within
                the Jewish tradition who have provided examples of leadership
                in this field, however, it has <b>not been a prominent concern</b> for
                Jews overall.</p>
              While most Jewish communities tacitly recognise the importance
              of environmental ethics, it is yet to become a <b>major focus</b> of
          day to day life for most Jews and their local communities. </div>
