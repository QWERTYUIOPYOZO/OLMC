		<h2>Influence of Maimonides on Judaism</h2>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p>  Maimonides' three major literary works, the <b>Mishneh
		          Torah</b>, the <b>Commentary on the Mishnah</b>, which
		          includes the 13 Principles of Faith, and the <b>Guide for the
		          Perplexed</b> along with his leadership of the Jewish community
		          has had a significant impact during his day and beyond. During his
		          time, Maimonides was able to consolidate Jewish communities in the
		          face of the dual threats of persecution from Muslim dominance and
	          challenges of classical philosophy.</p>
		      Maimonides is also influential today as his writings have subsequently
		      become the foundation for much Jewish teaching. The extent of the
		      effect of his contributions is evident in that he is held in high acclaim
		      by all strands of Judaism.</div>

            <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p>Almohades</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> Moses Maimonides was born in Cordoba in Spain 1135. At his time,
		        Spain was dominated by <b>Islamic culture</b> and religion
		        and Jews were considered to be second class citizens. The Jewish
		        people began to be persecuted in Spain in 1148, when Spain was invaded
		        by the fanatical Almohades. The Maimon family eventually settled in <b>Egypt</b> after
	          fleeing Islamic persecution.</p>
		      </div>
		  </div>
		  
		  <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p>Sephardim</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>As a Sephardi Jew, Maimonides was educated in both the <b>secular</b><b> sciences </b>and
in<b> Jewish studies</b>, that is, the Torah and the Talmud. This prolific
writer was appointed as the Chief Rabbi of the Egyptian Jewish community which
was one of the highest offices in the Jewish world in those days. The work of
Maimonides in <b>consolidating and strengthening</b> Judaism against
Islamic dominance, as well the revival of classical philosophy needs to be seen
in this context. </p>

	    </div>
			
			<div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote">
              <p> Codified Talmud</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> The nature of Maimonides' influence can be seen in three important
		        areas. The first are is his codification of the Talmud, the Mishneh <b>Torah</b>.
		        The aim of Maimonides' major work was to provide a topical <b>codification
		        of the Talmud</b> so as to facilitate a much easier access to
		        Jewish precepts. Prior to this work, in order for a Jew to find out
		        what they should do in any given circumstance, they would have to undertake
		        a laborious study of the entire text. This is significant because Judaism
		        is essentially a practical religion, concerned with the day to day
	          practice of <b>halakhic laws</b>.</p>
		      Essentially, therefore, the Mishneh Torah is significant because
		      it can be regarded as the first comprehensive, exhaustive, topical <b>codification
		      of the Talmud</b>. The very fact that it was written in Hebrew,
		      rather then Arabic, which was the language Maimonides used for most of
		      his works, gives is an indication of Maimonides' intentions for
		      this work. That is, this great reference work was to be used not only
		      by Arabic speaking Jews of his era but by Jews in all times. The importance
		      of the Mishneh Torah as a reference guide is evident in the fact that
		      it was met with almost <b>universal acclaim</b> across the
		      different strands of Judaism. </div>
		    </div>
			
			<div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote">
              <p>  Commentary on the Mishnah</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> The second realm of significant influence for Maimonides came through
		      his Commentary on the Mishnah which provided a comprehensive commentary
		      on each of the <b>tractates of the Mishnah</b>. Ultimately,
		      Maimonides intended this work to make Judaism more relevant to
		      the average Jew living in an Islamic society.
		      </p>
		      <p> In the Commentary on the Mishnah Maimonides provides a link between learning
  the Torah and putting it in practice by providing comprehensive commentary
  on each of the tractates of the Mishnah. He wrote in a <b>simple style</b> and <b>explained
  each mitzvot</b> outside the context of the Rabbinic discussion and went
  straight to the halakhic decision. This contribution is significant because
  it cuts across the convoluted rabbinic discourse in presenting the final halakhic
  decision. </p>

            <div class="footnote">
              <p> 13 Principles of Faith </p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> The third significant effect Maimonides had on Judaism was to formulate
		        the 13 Principles of Faith as contained in the Commentary on
		        the Mishnah. This now forms the basis for <b>credal statements</b> made
		        by Jews today. They highlight the main features of the Jewish
		        faith, and thus assist in consolidating Judaism by <b>clarifying
	          its core beliefs</b>.</p>
		      </div>
		    </div>
			
			<div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote">
              <p>Moreh Nevuchim</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> The fourth significant influence for Maimonides is his <b>integration</b> of
		        religion, science and philosophy primarily through his <b>Guide
		        for the Perplexed</b>. This text sought to rationalise Judaism
		        in relation to classical philosophy and show that Judaism had a <b>basis
	          in rational thought.</b></p>
		      <p> Here he tried to <b>resolve </b>some<b> apparent contradictions</b> in
		        the Jewish religion, which perplexed the Jewish community and particularly
		        those schooled in Aristotelian thought. In doing so, this work is helped
		        to <b>preserve faith in Judaism</b> by people who were genuinely
		        perplexed by the apparent contradictions in Jewish thought. Even more
		        significant is the fact that Maimonides helped to assure the Jews who
		        were less educated that their religion was one with a <b>sound
		        basis</b>, so that they would not turn away from Judaism.</p>
		      The Guide for the Perplexed is mainly concerned with the anthropomorphic
		      depictions of God, despite the belief about God's incorporeality.
		      He concluded that since this practice of referring to the hand of God
		      etc cannot be rationally sustained, one should not therefore refer to
		      God that way. Essentially, Maimonides can be described as a <b>religious
		      rationalist</b> who sought to rationalise religion in order to save
		      religion from being made irrelevant by rationalist philosophy. </div>
		    </div>
			
			<div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote">
              <p>Opposition to Moreh Nevuchim</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>This work was not however without its opponents. For example, the
		      fact that the integration of philosophy of religion had never fully been
		      embraced before meant that many regarded it as a <b>contravention
		      of the practiced wisdom</b> of the sages. But despite opposition
		      to his work, the extent of his influence in philosophy remains
		      as a profound one.</p>
		      <p>The significance of his work is upheld by people from
		      many different <b>strands
		      of Judaism</b>. But the different strands of Judaism place a slightly
		      different emphasis on which parts of Maimonides' work they value
		      the most. Zionists hold a high regard for Maimonides because Maimonides
		      declared that it is a mitzvah to take possession of Israel and
		      live in it. Orthodox Jews place a lot of emphasis on studying the works
		      of Maimonides in religious institutions because it is a guide to understanding
		      what is required of Jews on a day to day basis. Liberal and Reform Jews
		      on the other hand dispute some of his Talmudic commentary including a
		      number of the 13 principles of faith. Nevertheless, Liberal and Reform
		      Jews do hold his philosophical works in high regard. </p>

			<div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote">
              <p> Torah and Talmud </p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> It can be seen that Maimonides had a very significant effect on Judaism
		        as he consolidated it in the face of the <strong>t</strong><b>hreat of Islamic
		        dominance</b> and the <b>revival of classical philosophy</b>.
		        He did this by making the Torah and Talmud more understandable
		        and accessible to the everyday Jew through his works the <b>Mishneh
		        Torah</b> and the <b>Commentary on the Mishnah</b>.
		        He also made Judaism relevant in the face of threats from classical
		        philosophy through the <b>Guide for the Perplexed</b> where
		        he showed that Judaism was grounded in rationalism. The enormous
		        impact which Maimonides had on Judaism is reflected in the saying "from
	          Moshe to Moshe there arose none like Moshe".</p>
