            <div class="footnote"><p> Temple and synagogue </p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>The Temple <b>(Bet ha-Mikdash)</b> in Jerusalem was a unique
		      centre and dominant symbol for the entire Jewish nation; the synagogue <b>(Bet
		      ha-Knesset)</b> was an institution of a largely diversified and
		      decentralised Jewry which had become accustomed to living with
		      no political sovereignty. Although there were one or two attempts to
		      build a Temple outside of Israel a Temple could hold no real significance
		      outside of Jerusalem.</p>
		      <p> By contrast, a synagogue exists in every
		        Jewish community, no matter where. Moreover the Temple in Jerusalem was
		        a magnificent building, attended by a class of priests, and revolved
		        around the sacrifice. A synagogue, which may be housed even in the simplest
                structure, is distinguished only by the fact that it  <b>contains
                the Torah scroll</b>, acknowledges no authority
                other than that of the scriptures, and maintains <b>no
                sacrificial ritual</b> whatsoever.
                The synagogue is not a 'small temple', for it has
                a completely different function in Jewish <b>religious,
                social and cultural life</b><i>.</i> </p>
		    </div>
		  </div>
		  
		  <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p> Origin and history </p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> The origin of the synagogue is not quite clear. During the time
		            of the Talmud it was already so <b>well established</b> that
		            the Babylonian sages (amoraim) attributed its emergence to the
		            exile at the end of <b>the First Temple period</b>, identifying
		            it with the 'little sanctuary' mentioned in Ezekiel
		            11:16. '<i>Therefore say: Thus says the Lord God: Though
		            I removed them far away among the nations, and though I scattered
		            them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for
		            a little while in the countries where they have gone.'</i> The
		            Talmud sages assumed that the synagogues founded in Babylon, and
		            later in Palestine, were designed to fill the void left by the <b>destruction
		            of Solomon's Temple (586BCE)</b>. But, in fact, the
		            synagogue was to fulfil this role only after the <b>destruction
	              of the second Temple (70 CE).</b> </p>
		    </div>

		  <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote">
              <p> Multi purpose facility</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> According to existing sources (Philo of Alexandria, Josephus Flavius,
	          the New Testament) the synagogue initially served more as a multi-purpose <b>community
	          hall</b>: a centre for <b>individual study</b> or public <b>reading
	          of the Torah</b>, an <b>administration</b> office,
	          seat of the local <b>tribunal</b>, a place for making <b>public
	          announcements</b> and for collecting in <b>aid of the poor</b>.
	          It is quite possible it served different purposes in the Diaspora
	          to those in Palestine. In Egypt for instance it was referred to
	          as 'a
	          place of prayer' whereas in Palestine it was always 'a
	          place of assembly'.</p>
	          <p> The synagogue or, 'Beit Knesset' which means House of Assembly, 'Beit
  Midrash' (House of Study) and 'Beit Tefilah' are three terms
  that refer to the three fundamental functions of the synagogue: </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p> House of Assembly : The synagogue is a <b>meeting place for Jews</b>,
          where they share the important facets of their lives with one another
                    and achieve a sense of community. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p> House of Study: The chief function of the synagogue is to
                  serve as a <b>study
          house</b>. The study of Torah and other sacred books is the backbone
          of Jewish observance</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>House of Prayer: Another function of the synagogue is to
                serve as the locus where people meet for <b>prayer</b>. </p>
                </li>
              </ol>

            <div class="footnote"><p> Reading of Torah </p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>The <b>Torah</b> is read weekly in synagogues on <b>Shabbat
		          morning</b>, as well as on <b>Mondays and Thursdays</b>,
		          and on <b>holy days and festivals</b>. It is divided into
		          parshiot (portions) which are read consecutively, each week, throughout
		          the year. On certain days, because of festivals or an upcoming holiday,
		          special readings supplant the weekly reading. The cycle then recommences
		          the following week. The community begins reading the Torah, from
		          the first parshah, on Simchat Torah, and finish the following Simchat
		          Torah. Some synagogues employ the Triennial Cycle, which originated
	          in Palestine. </p>
		      Each Torah portion is divided into three sections: the first section
		      of each is read during the week for that designated Torah portion
		      during the first year of the three-year cycle; the second section of
		      each Torah portion is read during the second year of the cycle; and the
		      third section of each Torah portion is read during the third year of
		      the cycle. In this way, although part of each Torah portion is read within
		      one calendar year, it actually takes three years to complete the reading
		      of the entire Torah. There are many variations of the Triennial Cycle
	        in use.</div>

		  <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p> Daily services </p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>There are three daily services prescribed by tradition: <b>Ma'ariv,
	          Shacharit, and Minchah</b>. Musaf is an additional service for
	          Shabbat and holidays, though it is not included at all synagogues:</p>
	          <p>There
	          are multiple reasons for there being three daily prayer services
	          but the usual explanation is that each one of the three was initiated
	          by one of our patriarchs: Abraham (Genesis 22:3 -- "Abraham arose
	          early in the morning"), Isaac (Genesis 24:63 -- "Isaac went
	          out meditating in the field toward evening"), and Jacob (Genesis
	          28:11 "He came to that place
and stopped there for the night").</p>

            <div class="footnote"><p> Sacrifices </p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> In fact, the prayer services are also <b>substitutes for the
		          sacrifices</b> made in the Temple in Jerusalem prior to its
		          destruction in 69/70 C.E. The morning prayers (Shacharit) and
		          afternoon prayers (Minchah) correspond to the morning (Tamid offering)
	          and afternoon sacrifices (the second Tamid).</p>

              <p> Shema</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>The evening service, Ma'ariv, is not associated with a sacrifice.
		        Rather, it derives from the obligation to say the Shema in the evening
		        (the prayer itself says "you shall recite these words when you
		        lie down at night and when you rise up in the morning") hence
		        the Shema is said in the evening and morning, but not in the afternoon.
	          There is also a tradition that Daniel prayed thrice daily.</p>

		  <div class="content2"><h3>Rosh Hashanah</h3>
            <div class="footnote"><p>Selihot</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> After the clock strikes 12 midnight Jews go to the synagogue to say
		        Selihot. Services begin at midnight in a <b>grave mood</b>.
		        Special prayers of <b>repentance </b>are recited. Selihot
		        prayers ask for <b>forgiveness</b>. Some of them are beautiful
		        prayers composed for by Jewish scholars and poets recalling hardships,
		        persecution and martyrdom. Selihot prayers are said during the rest
	          of the ten days of repentance.</p>
	          The synagogue liturgy employs a number of metaphors which evoke
	          the themes of the season. Chief among them are the Sovereignty
	          of God, author of life and sole power in the universe, and the Book
            of Life.</div>

		  <div class="content2"><h3>Shofar</h3>
            <div class="footnote"><p>Revelation and redemption</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>Perhaps the most important aspect of the prayer services on <b>Rosh
              Hashanah</b> is the sounding of the shofar. The shofar is
              blown on the first day of Rosh Hashanah only if the first day is
              not the Sabbath day. The Torah beckons Jews to live their lives
              on the continuum between Revelation and Redemption. The names of
              the blasts of the shofar are (1) Tekiah (one long blast; (2) Shevarim
              (three short blasts); and (3) Teruah (nine staccato blasts). The
              shofar is blown during the Torah service of Rosh Hashanah morning,
              following the reading, and during the musaf amidah. The Sabbath
              between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur is a special Sabbath named
              Shabbat Shivah or Sabbath of penitence. At this service Rabbis
              usually deliver a sermon dealing with repentance.</p>
              <p>During the festival
                in some synagogues there is a long table covered with a charity
                plates placed along it. The names of each charity denote each
                plate so that the congregation can choose which charity they
                will contribute to. These are passed around to collect contributions
                for the poor and needy as part of the responsibility to <b> Tzedekah</b> (righteousness).</p>
		    </div>

		  <div class="content2">
            <div class="footnote"><p>Yom Kippur</p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> The prayer services of Yom Kippur are many and long. The prayer
              book is a called a <b>Machzor</b> (from the root meaning "return" because
              of the cyclical nature of the year.) They feature <b>confessional
              prayers</b> of both a private and communal nature. Yom Kippur
              is both a <b>somber and celebratory time</b>. Yom Kippur
              marks the end of the Ten Days of Repentance set aside each year
              for Jews to affect repentance from the sins of the past year. Their <b>repentance</b> culminates
              in a day of prayer and <b>fasting</b>. Fasting -- afflicting
              their bodies -- serves to atone for all those sins toward God which
              have not already been atoned for by other means.</p>
              <p>Tradition holds
                that sins between human beings must be taken care of prior to
                Yom Kippur by the offending <b>asking the forgiveness</b> of
                the one offended. Whatever can be rectified must be rectified.
                Once this has happened and the two people are reconciled, the
                offender can approach God and ask God's forgiveness because in
                hurting another human being, the offender sinned against God,
                as well. The fast of Yom Kippur atones for these sins. Atonement
                brings about a <b>spiritual cleansing</b>, a cleaning
                of the slate, and it is this religious experience which makes
                it a celebratory day, as Jews are confident in God's forgiveness.
                God is a <b>merciful and forgiving God</b> and
  sincere repentance is always rewarded with forgiveness. </p>

		      <p>                <b> Yikor </b> is a memorial service for
		        those who have died. A portion of the prophets is read. The book of
		        Jonah is read in the afternoon to show that God is with us and that
                his love embraces all people on the earth. At the very end of
                the service the <b>Shofar</b> is blown for the first

		    <div class="text">
		      <p> It is traditional for people to gather, either in their synagogue,
              or in <b>small groupings of family and friends</b> in
              their homes, to break the fast of Yom Kippur together. In the <b>Sukkoth
              service</b> the Hallel prayers are recited at the morning
              service and a procession with the etrog and the luluv take place.
              The four species of plant, willow, palm, myrtle (bound together
              and named a luluv) and citron (etrog) symbolize the agricultural
              abundance of the land and God's role in nourishing Israel. During
              the time when the Temple stood in Jerusalem, the four species were
              used daily in the Temple during Sukkot.</p>
              <p>After the Destruction of
                the Second Temple, the four species were used as part of the <b>synagogue ritual</b>,
                waved during Hallel (specifically, while reciting Psalm 118),
                only on the first day by biblical ordinance, but the rabbis decreed
                that it should be brought to the synagogue every day during Sukkot
  with the exception of Shabbat, when the prohibition against carrying took precedence. </p>
