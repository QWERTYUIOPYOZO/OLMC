									<ul>
                                      <li> The synagogue is the centre of the
                                        Jewish religious community. </li>
                                      <li> The Hebrew name for a synagogue is 'Beit
                                        Knesset' which means House of Assembly.
                                        It also goes by the names 'Beit
                                        Midrash' (House of Study) and 'Beit
                                        Tefilah' (House of Prayer).</li>
                                      <li> Some ritual practices that take place
                                        in synagogues are; marriages, part of
                                        the Shabbat celebration, services for
                                        festivals, baby naming ceremonies, the
                                        initiation rites of Bar or Bat Mitzvahs
                                        and remembrance ceremonies for the dead. </li>
                                      <li> The synagogue service follows an order
                                        as follows:<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Kabbalat Shabbat is an example
                                        of warm-up prayers for the Shabbat evening
                                        service.) <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Shema and its Blessings: (Beginning
                                        with the Barechu, the Call to Worship,
                                        and including prayers on the themes of
                                        Creation, Revelation, and Redemption.
                                        <br>

                                        Amidah (Also known as <em>Ha-Tefillah</em> or <em>Shemona
		                                Esrei</em>, the Amidah is the worshiper's opportunity
		                                to approach God in private prayer, reciting
		                                both the words in the siddur as well
		                                as whatever prayers his/her heart may prompt.
		                                Because the recitation of this prayer is a
		                                central religious obligation, and has always
		                                been public by nature, it is often repeated
		                                in full by the chazzan (cantor) after the congregation
		                                has been given time to recite the prayer privately.</li>

                                      <li> Torah Service: There is a Torah service
                                        only on those occasions when Torah is
                                        read: Shabbat and festival mornings,
                                        Shabbat and Yom Kippur afternoon. <b></b></li>
                                      <li> There are a few significant differences
                                        in the way that services are conducted
                                        in different movements:<br>
                                        <br>
                                        In Orthodox,
                                          women and men are seated separately;
                                          in Progressive and Conservative, all
                                          sit together. <br>
                                          <br>
                                        In Orthodox and usually
                                        Conservative, everything is in Hebrew.
                                        In Progressive most of the service
                                      is conducted in English, although they
                                      are increasingly using Hebrew. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In Orthodox,
                                        the person leading the service has his
                                        back to the congregation, and prays facing
		                              the same direction as the congregation;
                                        in Conservative and Progressive, the
                                        person leading the service faces the
                                        congregation. Conservative and Progressive
		                              are rather rigidly structured: everybody
                                        shows up at the same time, leaves at
                                        the same time, and does the same thing
                                        at the same time; Orthodox is somewhat
                                        more free-form: people show up when they
                                        show up, catch up to everybody else at
                                        their own pace, often do things differently
                                      than everybody else</li>
        </ul>
		                            <ul>
                                      <li> Children are welcome in the synagogue.
                                        They are not be expected to sit for hours
                                        throughout a long service. It is perfectly
                                        acceptable for them to walk out to stretch
                                        their legs now and then and talk with
                                        friends. Many synagogues provide babysitting
                                        for young children and have playgrounds. </li>
                                      <li> In most synagogues, it is customary
                                        for people to cover their heads as a
                                        sign of respect for God and acknowledgement
                                        that there is something that is "above" humanity
                                        in the universe. </li>
                                      <li> The Holy Ark (Aron Ha-kodesh) is on
                                        the eastern wall. The ark of the modern
                                        synagogue is reminiscent of the ark in
                                        which the Israelites kept the Torah,
                                        which according to tradition God gave
                                        to Moses on Mount Sinai. It contains
                                        the Sifrei Torah. </li>
                                      <li> An Eternal Light (Ner Tamid) hangs
                                        above the ark in every synagogue It is
                                        associated with the continuously burning
                                        incense altar which stood in front of
                                        the ark. The Jewish sages interpreted
                                        the Ner Tamid as a symbol of God's
                                        eternal and imminent Presence in Jewish
                                        communities and the people's lives. </li>
                                      <li> The Menorah: The seven-branched lampstand
                                        which stood in the Temple in Jerusalem
                                        is symbolized in many modern sanctuaries
                                        by the menorah </li>
                                      <li> Charity is compulsory in the Jewish
                                        tradition, because the poor need it.
                                        Many synagogues have a Tzedekah boxes
                                        to enable people who come to worship,
                                        study and celebrate to fulfil the precept
                                        of righteousness. </li>
                                      <li> The Hazzan (cantor) is specially trained
                                        in the art of Jewish music and liturgy
                                        for this role. In many congregations,
                                        the cantor is professionally trained
                                        and studies a broad pallet of Jewish
                                        subjects in addition to those mentioned
                                        above, and does a good deal of teaching,
                                        counselling, and life-cycle officiation
                                        in addition to leading the community
                                        in prayer. </li>
                                      <li> Gabbai - two people standing on either
                                        side of the reading table while the Torah
                                        is read, who assist the reader and make
                                        sure that the Torah Service runs smoothly.
                                        These people are the gabbaim. It is their
                                        job to call people to the Torah for their
                                        aliyot, check that the reader makes no
                                        mistakes while reading the Torah, and
                                        provide correction if a mistake is made,
                                        recites the Mi Sheberach for those who
                                        have had an aliyah, and see to the mechanics
                                        of covering and uncovering the Torah
                                        scroll at the appropriate times . </li>
                                      <li> Hagbahah - after the Torah has been
                                        read, the congregation will be asked
                                        to stand and someone will lift the scroll
                                        above his/her head. This person will
                                        then turn around so that the side of
                                        the scroll with the writing faces the
                                        congregation, and turn as necessary to
                                        enable everyone assembled to view the
                                        scroll, since not everyone received the
                                        honour of an aliyah, thereby enabling
                                        them to peer into the scroll that morning. </li>
                                      <li> The word aliyah means "ascending" and
                                        refers to the act of going up to the
                                        Torah (which is read from the bima on
                                        a level higher than that of the congregation,
                                        signifying its holiness) and reciting
                                        the blessing over the Torah. </li>
                                      <li> Two books are used during a Jewish
                                        prayer service: the siddur (prayer book)
                                        and the chumash (a printed edition of
                                        the Torah) The term siddur is derived
                                        from the Hebrew root 'order' because
                                        the prayers are recited in a prescribed
                                        order. A printed edition of the Torah,
                                        called the chumash, is used when the
                                        Torah is read, so that the congregation
                                        can follow along with the reading. Both
                                        the siddur and the chumash are considered
                                        sifrei kodesh (holy books) because they
                                        contain the Tetragrammaton (the ineffable
                                        name of God). </li>
                                      <li>Attached to the synagogue
                                        is a Rabbi. Rabbi" means "teacher" and,

                                        classes, and individual counseling, teaching
                                        is the primary duty of a rabbi.</li>

                                      <ul><li> The Temple (Bet
	                                      ha-Mikdash) in Jerusalem was a unique
                                        center and dominant symbol for the entire
                                        Jewish nation; the synagogue (Bet ha-Knesset)
                                        was an institution of a largely diversified
	                                      and decentralised Jewry which had become
                                        accustomed to living with no political
                                        sovereignty. </li>
                                      <li>A synagogue exists in every
                                          Jewish community, no matter where.
                                        Moreover the Temple in Jerusalem was
                                        a magnificent building, attended by a
                                        class of priests, and revolved around
                                        the sacrifice. A synagogue , which may
                                        be housed even in the simplest structure,
                                        is distinguished only by the fact that
                                        it contains the Torah scroll, acknowledges
                                        no authority other than that of the scriptures,
                                      and maintains no sacrifical ritual whatsoever.</li>
                                      <li> The synagogue or, 'Beit Knesset' which
                                        means House of Assembly, 'Beit
                                        Midrash' (House of Study) and 'Beit
                                        Tefilah' are three terms that refer
                                        to the three fundamental functions of
                                    the synagogue: </li>
                                      <li>House of Assembly : The synagogue
                                          is a meeting place for Jews, where
                                        they share the important facets of their
                                        lives with one another and achieve a
                                        sense of community. </li>
                                      <li>House of Study: The
                                          chief function of the synagogue is
                                        to serve as a study house. The study
                                        of Torah and other sacred books is the
                                        backbone of Jewish observance. </li>
                                      <li>House
                                          of Prayer : Another function of the
                                        synagogue is to serve as the locus where
                                        people meet for prayer. </li>
                                      <li>The Torah is
                                          read weekly in synagogues on Shabbat
                                          morning, as well as on Mondays and
                                        Thursdays, and on holy days and festivals.
                                        It is divided into parshiot (portions)
                                        which are read consecutively, each week,
                                        throughout the year. In this way, although
                                        part of each Torah portion is read within
                                          one calendar year, it actually takes
                                          three years to complete the reading
                                        of the entire Torah. </li>
                                      <li>There are three
                                          daily services prescribed by tradition:
                                          Ma'ariv, Shacharit, and Minchah. Musaf
                                          is an additional service for Shabbat
                                          and holidays, though it is not included
                                        at all synagogues: </li>
                                      <li>There are multiple
                                        reasons for there being three daily prayer
                                        services but the usual explanation is
                                        that each one of the three was initiated
                                        by one of our patriarchs: Abraham (Genesis
                                        22:3 -- "Abraham arose early in
                                        the morning"),
                                        Isaac (Genesis 24:63 -- "Isaac went
                                        out meditating in the field toward evening"),
                                        and Jacob (Genesis 28:11 "He came
                                        to that place and stopped there for the
                                        night"). </li>
                                      <li>Rosh Hashanah - After the
                                          clock strikes 12 midnight Jews go to
                                          the synagogue to say Selihot. Services
                                          begin at midnight in a grave mood.
                                        Special prayers of repentance are recited.
                                        Selihot prayers ask for forgiveness.                                        </li>
                                      <li>Shofar - Perhaps the most important
                                        aspect of the prayer services on Rosh
                                        Hashanah is the sounding of the shofar.
                                        The shofar is blown on the first day
                                        of Rosh Hashanah only if the first day
                                        is not the Sabbath day. </li>
                                      <li> The prayer services
                                        of Yom Kippur are many and long. The
                                        prayer book is a called a Machzor (from
                                        the root meaning "return" because
                                        of the cyclical nature of the year.)
                                        They feature confessional prayers of
                                        both a private and communal nature. </li>
                                      <li> Yom Kippur is both a sombre and celebratory
                                          time. Yom Kippur marks the end of the
                                          Ten Days of Repentance, set aside each
                                          year for Jews to affect repentance
                                        from the sins of the past year. </li>
                                      <li>Atonement
                                          brings about a spiritual cleansing,
                                        a cleaning of the slate, and it is this
                                          religious experience which makes it
                                        a celebratory day, as Jews are confident
                                          in God's forgiveness. God is a merciful
                                          and forgiving God and sincere repentance
                                          is always rewarded with forgiveness.                                        </li>
                                      <li>Yikor is a memorial service for those
                                            who have died. A portion of the prophets
                                            is read. The book of Jonah is read
                                          in the afternoon to show that God is
                                          with us and that his love embraces
                                        all people on the earth. </li>
                                      <li>At the very
                                          end of the service the Shofar is blown
                                          for the first and last time in a long
                                          steady note and the Day of Atonement
                                        is over. </li>
                                      <li>It is traditional
                                              for people to gather, either in
                                        their synagogue, or in small groupings
                                          of family and friends in their homes,
                                          to break the fast of Yom Kippur together.

                                        prayers are recited at the morning service
                                          and a procession with the etrog and
