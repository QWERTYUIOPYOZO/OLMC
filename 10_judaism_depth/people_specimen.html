	    <p> Maimonides, a prolific writer and spiritual leader contributed to Judaism
	      by seeking to consolidate Jewish communities in the face of dual threats
	      of persecution from Muslim communities and challenges of classical philosophy.
	      Maimonides did this is through his three major literary works. Firstly,
	      Maimonides codified the Talmud in his Mishneh Torah to facilitate the
	      study of the Torah. Secondly, in response to the threat of classical philosophy
	      Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed brought together philosophy
	      and religion, to show how faith was compatible with reason. Thirdly, in
	      his Commentary for the Mishnah Maimonides' 13 Principles of Faith,
	      which is significant as it forms the basis for many Jewish credal statements
	      today.</p>

	    <p> Maimonides' leadership and his three major literary works the
	      Mishneh Torah, Commentary on the Mishnah and the Guide for the Perplexed
	      has had a monumental impact upon Judaism.</p>
	    <p> Maimonides' most significant contribution to Judaism is with his
	      major work the Mishneh Torah. In this work Maimonides undertakes a thorough
	      and systematic topical codification of the Talmud. The aim of this work
	      was to facilitate the study of the Torah. The result of this was that
	      he able to make the Torah more accessible and thus Judaism more relevant
	      to the average Jew living in an Islamic world. This exhaustive study was
	      to form the basis of other codifications at later times.</p>
	    <p> The second important contribution made by Maimonides to Judaism was
	      his Commentary on the Mishnah where he explains the meaning of each mitzvot
	      outside the context of Rabbinic discussion. The result of this work which
	      focused directly on the final halakhic decision was the fact that he was
	      able to make the Torah more accessible to ordinary Jews.</p>
	    <p> The third major contribution made by Maimonides was his philosophical
	      treatise, the Guide for the Perplexed. The aim of this work was to bring
	      together religion and philosophy in such a way as to show that Judaism
	      was grounded in and compatible with logic. The effect of this was that
	      he was able to consolidate Judaism against the threat posed by classical
	      Greek philosophy.</p>
	    <p> The fourth major contribution made by Maimonides is his formulation
	      of the 13 principles of the Jewish faith. This formulation is significant
	      because it was to form the basis of many Jewish credal statements. For
	      example today, Maimonides' 13 principles of faith are appended to
	      every edition of the Talmud published today.</p>

		<li>Analyse the contribution of ONE significant person or school or thought to Judaism (6)</li>
		</ol>
		</b>
	    <p> Maimonides' contribution to Judaism is difficult to underestimate.
	      The two major areas of this contribution lie in the facilitation of Torah
	      study, through the Commentary on the Mishnah and the Mishneh Torah and
	      the marrying of religion, science and philosophy in the Moreh Nevuchim.</p>
	    <p> The first realm of significant contribution came through his Commentary
	      on the Mishnah. The Commentary on the Mishnah is a book which provides
	      a comprehensive commentary on each of the tractates of the Mishnah. This
	      work is significant Maimonides highlights the meaning of each Mishnah
	      outside the context of rabbinic discourse. Thus, by cutting across the
	      convoluted rabbinic discourse Jews can more readily find out how they
	      can apply the Oral Torah to day to day life.</p>
	    <p> The second area of influence that relates to Maimonides' role
	      in the codification of the Talmud is with his major work, the Mishneh
	      Torah. The Mishneh Torah was written with the intent to provide a comprehensive
	      topically systematic codification of the Talmud. The intention of this
	      work was to facilitate the study of the Torah which Maimonides believed
	      would strengthen Judaism in the face of Islamic dominance. Even opposition
	      against the Mishneh Torah by some scholars who feared that this work would
	      supplant the use of the Torah, could not diminish the monumental importance
	      of this work.</p>
	    <p> The third area of Maimonides' contribution lies in his philosophical
	      treatise, the Guide for the Perplexed. The Guide sought to explain
	      the apparent contradictions in Jewish theory, particularly the issue
	      of God's
	      incorporeality versus the anthropomorphic depictions of God in the
	      sacred texts. Maimonides concluded that where a religious doctrine
	      is incompatible with logic, it should not be taken at its face value.
	      Essentially, the Guide for the Perplexed is significant because it reflects
	      the integration of philosophy and religion to a previously unprecedented
	      level. As a result of this, Maimonides helped to strengthen the validity
	      of Judaism from the threats of classical philosophy. </p>

	    <p><b> Question 5 - Judaism </b><b> (20 marks)</b></p>
	    <p><b> Describe the contribution and analyse the effect of ONE significant
	        person or school or thought on Judaism</b></p>
	    <p> Maimonides' three major literary works, the Mishneh Torah, the
	      Commentary on the Mishnah, which includes the 13 Principles of Faith,
	      and the Guide for the Perplexed along with his leadership of the Jewish
	      community has had a significant impact during his day and beyond. During
	      his time, Maimonides was able to consolidate Jewish communities in the
	      face of the dual threats of persecution from Muslim dominance and challenges
	      of classical philosophy.</p>
	    <p> Maimonides is also influential today as his writings have subsequently
	      become the foundation for much Jewish teaching. The extent of the effect
	      of his contributions is evident in that he is held in high acclaim by
	      all strands of Judaism.</p>
	    <p> Moses Maimonides was born in Cordoba in Spain 1135. At his time, Spain
	      was dominated by Islamic culture and religion and Jews were considered
	      to be second class citizens. The Jewish people began to be persecuted
	      in Spain in 1148, when Spain was invaded by the fanatical Almohades. The
	      Maimon family eventually settled in Egypt after fleeing Islamic persecution.</p>
	    <p> As a Sephardi Jew, Maimonides was educated in both the secular sciences
	      and in Jewish studies, that is, the Torah and the Talmud. This prolific
	      writer was appointed as the Chief Rabbi of the Egyptian Jewish community
	      which was one of the highest offices in the Jewish world in those days.
	      The work of Maimonides in consolidating and strengthening Judaism against
	      Islamic dominance, as well the revival of classical philosophy needs to
	      be seen in this context.</p>
	    <p> The nature of Maimonides' influence can be seen in three important
	      areas. The first are is his codification of the Talmud, the Mishneh Torah.
	      The aim of Maimonides' major work was to provide a topical codification
	      of the Talmud so as to facilitate a much easier access to Jewish precepts.
	      Prior to this work, in order for a Jew to find out what they should do
	      in any given circumstance, they would have to undertake a laborious study
	      of the entire text. This is significant because Judaism is essentially
	      a practical religion, concerned with the day to day practice of halakhic
	      laws.</p>
	    <p> Essentially, therefore, the Mishneh Torah is significant because it
	      can be regarded as the first comprehensive, exhaustive, topical codification
	      of the Talmud. The very fact that it was written in Hebrew, rather then
	      Arabic, which was the language Maimonides used for most of his works,
	      gives is an indication of Maimonides' intentions for this work.
	      That is, this great reference work was to be used not only by Arabic speaking
	      Jews of his era but by Jews in all times. The importance of the Mishneh
	      Torah as a reference guide is evident in the fact that it was met with
	      almost universal acclaim across the different strands of Judaism. </p>
	    <p> The second realm of significant influence for Maimonides came through
	      his Commentary on the Mishnah which provided a comprehensive commentary
	      on each of the tractates of the Mishnah. Ultimately, Maimonides intended
	      this work to make Judaism more relevant to the average Jew living in an
	      Islamic society.</p>
	    <p> In the Commentary on the Mishnah Maimonides provides a link between
	      learning the Torah and putting it in practise by providing comprehensive
	      commentary on each of the tractates of the Mishnah. He wrote in a simple
	      style and explained each mitzvot outside the context of the Rabbinic discussion
	      and went straight to the halakhic decision. This contribution is significant
	      because it cuts across the convoluted rabbinic discourse in presenting
	      the final halakhic decision.</p>
	    <p> The third significant effect Maimonides had on Judaism was to formulate
	      the 13 Principles of Faith as contained in the Commentary on the Mishnah.
	      This now forms the basis for credal statements made by Jews today. They
	      highlight the main features of the Jewish faith, and thus assist in consolidating
	      Judaism by clarifying its core beliefs.</p>
	    <p> The fourth significant influence for Maimonides is his integration of
	      religion, science and philosophy primarily through his Guide for the Perplexed.
	      This text sought to rationalise Judaism in relation to classical philosophy
	      and show that Judaism had a basis in rational thought.</p>
	    <p> Here he tried to resolve some apparent contradictions in the Jewish
	      religion, which perplexed the Jewish community and particularly those
	      schooled in Aristotelian thought. In doing so, this work is helped to
	      preserve faith in Judaism by people who were genuinely perplexed by the
	      apparent contradictions in Jewish thought. Even more significant is the
	      fact that Maimonides helped to assure the Jews who were less educated
	      that their religion was one with a sound basis, so that they would not
	      turn away from Judaism.</p>
	    <p> The Guide for the Perplexed is mainly concerned with the anthropomorphic
	      depictions of God, despite the belief about God's incorporeality.
	      He concluded that since this practice of referring to the hand of God
	      etc cannot be rationally sustained, one should not therefore refer to
	      God that way. Essentially, Maimonides can be described as a religious
	      rationalist who sought to rationalise religion in order to save religion
	      from being made irrelevant by rationalist philosophy.</p>
	    <p> This work was not however without its opponents. For example, the fact
	      that the integration of philosophy of religion had never fully been embraced
	      before meant that many regarded it as a contravention of the practised
	      wisdom of the sages. But despite opposition to his work, the extent of
	      his influence in philosophy remains as a profound one.</p>
	    <p> The significance of his work is upheld by people from many different
	      strands of Judaism. But the different strands of Judaism place a slightly
	      different emphasis on which parts of Maimonides' work they value
	      the most. Zionists hold a high regard for Maimonides because Maimonides
	      declared that it is a mitzvah to take possession of Israel and live in
	      it. Orthodox Jews place a lot of emphasis on studying the works of Maimonides
	      in religious institutions because it is a guide to understanding what
	      is required of Jews on a day to day basis. Liberal and Reform Jews on
	      the other hand dispute some of his Talmudic commentary including a number
	      of the 13 principles of faith. Nevertheless, Liberal and Reform Jews do
	      hold his philosophical works in high regard.</p>
	    <p> It can be seen that Maimonides had a very significant effect on Judaism
	      as he consolidated it in the face of the threat of Islamic dominance and
	      the revival of classical philosophy. He did this by making the Torah and
	      Talmud more understandable and accessible to the everyday Jew through
	      his works the Mishneh Torah and the Commentary on the Mishnah. He also
	      made Judaism relevant in the face of threats from classical philosophy
	      through the Guide for the Perplexed where he showed that Judaism was grounded
	      in rationalism. The enormous impact which Maimonides had on Judaism is
	      reflected in the saying "from Moshe to Moshe there arose none like
	      Moshe".</p>
