	    <h3> Environmental Ethics in Jewish History</h3>
	    <ul class="summary_points">
          <li> Judaism has a long and rich tradition of environmental ethics </li>
          <li> Three thousand years of biblical and rabbinic teaching </li>
          <li> Until recently Judaism has lacked a clear and prominent response
            to ecological issues </li>
          <li> In the last few decades that environmental ethics have become
            a significant focus </li>
          <li> Yet to filter down to many local communities </li>
          <li> Rich but largely untapped source of guidance </li>
          <li> Jewish communities felt they were dealing with more urgent matters </li>
          <li> Also Jews were by and large unaware of the seriousness of the
            environmental crisis until recent times. </li>
          <li> Development of a modern movement of environmental ethics within
            Judaism has paralleled the broader social movement of concern for
            the environment </li>
          <li> Many Jewish writers have begun to rediscover the traditional teaching </li>
          <li> Bringing it into sharper focus in the light of the ecological
            crisis </li>
          <li> Pre-industrialised societies simply did not have the capacity
            to achieve environmental degradation at the rate and to the extent
            that modern societies do Judaism has only recently recognised an
            urgent need to bring environmental teaching to the fore. </li>
          <li> Difficulty resulting from understanding of the biblical command
            to subdue and have dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:28) </li>
          <li> Led some Jews to regard the earth as the possession of humankind
            and provided a tacit endorsement for it to be exploited </li>
          <li> Hasidic Rebbe Simcha Bunam instructed his followers to highlighted
            the tension that has existed between the ideas of humankind being
            given dominion over the rest of creation and that of its responsibility
            to care for creation </li>
          <li> Rashi saw this dominion as something that is only relevant when
            enacted with the appropriate standards of responsibility </li>
          <li> Moses Maimonides includes reflection on this issue in Moreh Nevukim            </li>
          <li>He concludes that "all the other beings have been created for
            their own sakes, and not for the sake of something else"</li>
        </ul>
	    <h3> Biblical Reflections on Environment</h3>
	    <ul class="summary_points">
          <li> Jewish writings have a number of ecological themes </li>
          <li> Many are taken from the Tenak </li>
          <li> There are also specific teachings on environment to be found in
            the Talmud </li>
          <li> The first example is that of the creation stories of Genesis 1-2 </li>
          <li> Biblical accounts of creation convey a number of important insights </li>
          <li> Insights concern creation and the relationships and responsibilities
            that exist between God, humankind and the rest of the created order </li>
          <li> Jews draw significant religious truths from these accounts </li>
          <li> God is the creator of all things </li>
          <li> There is a close relationship between God and the created world </li>
          <li> The created world is a good thing </li>
          <li> Human beings have a particular responsibility, known as stewardship,
            for the created world </li>
          <li> Failure to fulfill this responsibility of stewardship will inevitably
            lead to undesirable consequences for humankind </li>
          <li> One of the more significant verses in this section of the Tenak
            is Genesis 1:28 Includes the instructions to have dominion and to
            subdue the earth </li>
          <li> These instructions which have contributed to the historical exploitation
            of the environment </li>
          <li> Some interpretations suggest that humankind had been given license
            to freely use the world's resources </li>
          <li> Commentaries on this text in the Oral Torah challenge the view
            that humankind has been given divine sanction to selfishly exploit
            the world's resources </li>
          <li> Contemporary interpretations highlight the mutual relationship
            between humankind and the rest of creation </li>
          <li> The world provides resources needed for human life </li>
          <li> The negligent use of these resources will lead to environmental
            degradation and a loss of the capacity of the earth to provide </li>
          <li> Thus this passage forms part of the teaching on stewardship in
            the Jewish tradition </li>
          <li> Jews are taught that they have a fundamental responsibility to
            care for creation God's partners in creation and are responsible
            for ensuring that it is nurtured and cared for in sustainable ways </li>
          <li> Jewish understanding of stewardship guards against selfish or
            careless exploitation of the world's resources </li>
          <li> Genesis speaks of God placing humankind in the garden and instructing
            them to till it and guard it </li>
          <li> One of many examples in the Tenak where instructions are given
            regarding the responsible use of the land for agriculture </li>
          <li> These instructions from Genesis 2:15 are further aspects highlighting
            the Jewish understanding of stewardship </li>
          <li> The earth's resources will provide for human need </li>
          <li> Humankind has a responsibility to protect environment and ensure
            it remains fruitful </li>
          <li> Torah requires responsible agricultural practices </li>
          <li> Fields are to lie fallow every seventh year </li>
          <li> Ensure the continued fertility of the soil </li>
          <li> Guard against over taxing its resources (Leviticus 25:5-6) </li>
          <li> Texts anticipating future messianic times also convey some important
            environmental themes </li>
          <li> Isaiah 11:1-9 and Joel 2:21-26 show a flourishing environment
            and a state of harmony between humankind and the rest of creation </li>
          <li> These messianic visions reflect beliefs of a future time where
            people will live according to the will of God </li>
          <li> Environmental wellbeing is integral to this vision </li>
          <li> Deuteronomy 20:19-20 includes instructions about the conduct of
            a siege in the context of war </li>
          <li> Prohibits the wanton destruction of the crops of the besieged
            city </li>
          <li> The text highlights the wrong involved in any needless destruction
            of the natural environment </li>
          <li> This passage is the foundation for the Talmudic principle of bal
            tashkhit </li>
          <li> Fundamental to the understanding of Jewish environmental ethics </li>
          <li> Rabbis saw a parallel to any unnecessary environmental destruction </li>
          <li> Extended the meaning of the text to cover all such situations </li>
          <li> In the buildings of towns and cities, the Torah requires that
            sufficient space is left surrounding the urban area for agricultural
            purposes </li>
          <li> This requirement in Numbers 35:3-5 ensures that there is not an
            overpopulation of a particular region through urban sprawl </li>
          <li> Ensures that there is sufficient undeveloped land to provide a
            rural buffer between towns </li>
          <li> Further teachings prevent hunters from killing the adult and its
            offspring on the same day (Deuteronomy 22:6-7 &amp; Leviticus 22:28) </li>
          <li> Prevent the destruction of a species which would result if a generation
            was not able to reproduce </li>
          <li> Texts provide for animals to be given the same Sabbath rest as
            humans enjoy. (Exodus 20:11, Exodus 23:12, Deuteronomy 5:14) </li>
          <li> Two other elements of ecology are also found in the Tenak </li>
          <li> Reverence and respect for creation espoused in the Psalms </li>
          <li> Assessment of the relative insignificance of humanity in the light
            of the wonders of creation found in the book of Job 39-41 </li>
          <li> These examples challenge an anthropocentric view </li>
          <li> Does not exalt humankind over the rest of creation </li>
          <li> Anthropocentric view leads inevitably to exploitation of environment </li>
          <li> Judaism does not regard humankind as the same as the rest of creation
            Humankind is distinct from the rest of creation because of its self
            awareness </li>
          <li>Judaism opposes a view which allows humankind to be exalted
              over creation</li>
        </ul>
	    <h3> Environmental Ethics in the Oral Torah</h3>
	    <ul class="summary_points">
          <li> Oral Torah is significant in understanding the approach to environmental
            ethics </li>
          <li> Discussions of the Rabbis have led to important applications of
            the principles set down in the Torah </li>
          <li> Provide clear guidance to the Jewish communities in terms of their
            relationship to the environment and their responsibility to protect
            it </li>
          <li> Teaching of the Rabbis are direct developments from the ancient
            principles expressed in the Torah and provide a more detailed analysis
            of the issue </li>
          <li> Fundamental law of bal tashkhit underpins the teaching of the
            Jewish tradition on the environment </li>
          <li> Based on a passage which prohibits wanton destruction of crops
            etc during the siege of a city (Deuteronomy 20:19) </li>
          <li> The principle of bal tashkhit is not only fundamental to Jewish
            environmental ethics but is essentially a paradigm for Jewish ethics
            as a whole </li>
          <li> Bal tashkhit means do not destroy </li>
          <li> It has been used to prohibit any form of needless or careless
            destruction, waste or excessive use of resources </li>
          <li> In its original form, bal tashkhit prohibits the destruction of
            fruit trees </li>
          <li> Others may be cut down but fruit trees must be preserved for the
            food they provide </li>
          <li> Talmud extends this specific teaching to a range of applications. "Whoever
            breaks vessels, or tears garments, or destroys a building, or clogs
            a well, or does away with food in a destructive manner violates the
            negative mitzvah of bal tashkhit&"<em> (</em>Kiddushin<em> 32a) </em></li>
          <li> Talmud uses the principle of bal tashkhit to prohibit the unnecessary
            slaughter of animals and the wasting of fuel </li>
          <li> There is also a suggestion that extravagant eating when plainer
            options are available is a violation of bal tashkhit (Shabbat 140b) </li>
          <li> Further actions prohibited by the principle of bal tashkhit include
            the diverting of water supplies from people or from their crops </li>
          <li> Moses Maimonides taught that a person should be particular about
            not being extravagant or unnecessarily wasteful </li>
          <li> Maimonides taught that to bury a person in good or expensive garments
            rather than providing for the needs of the poor violated the principle
            of bal tashkhit (Mishneh Torah, Mourning 14:24) </li>
          <li> Maimonides also qualifies the application of bal tashkhit by ruling
            that it is lawful to cut down fruit trees in certain circumstances
            such as when it may be harming more valuable crops or damaging the
            property of another </li>
          <li> He notes that the Torah prohibits only unnecessary destruction
            (Mishneh Torah, Law of Kings 6:8-9) </li>
          <li> Other aspects of the Oral Torah remind the Jewish people of their
            responsibility for care for the environment </li>
          <li> The Talmud includes the following famous reflection on the creation
            stories of Genesis " See to it you do not spoil and destroy
            My world; for if you do, there will be no one else to repair it." (Kohelet
            7:13) </li>
          <li> Hierarchy of Jewish values clearly considers human beings to be
            more important that the world of flora and fauna </li>
          <li> Does not sanction an anthropocentric view of creation which puts
            elements of the environment at risk of exploitation by humankind </li>
          <li> The Talmud teaches that human beings should not over rate their
            importance in comparison to the rest of creation </li>
          <li> "Why were human beings created last in the order of Creation?...So
            they should not grow proud, for one can say to them, "The gnat
            came before you in the Creation!" (Sanhedrin 38a) </li>
          <li> Maimonides teaches that "This world was not brought into
            being by human endeavor, nor does it exist only for humans" (Moreh
            Nevukim, 456) </li>
          <li> Jewish tradition also teaches against the kind of greed and desire
            which leads to excess and ultimately to exploitation of resources </li>
          <li> Talmud teaches "who is rich? One who is happy with his portion." (Pirkei
            Avot 4:1)</li>
        </ul>
	    <h3> Development of Modern Environmental Concerns</h3>
	    <ul class="summary_points">
          <li> Recognition of the fragility of the environment and the limited
            extent of the world's resources is a relatively recent development </li>
          <li> Pre industrialised societies have had a far lesser impact on the
            environment than that of modern communities </li>
          <li> Throughout the history of Judaism people were largely unaware
            of the urgency of their responsibilities towards the environment </li>
          <li> Jewish teaching saw that it was important for human beings to
            fully utilise the gifts and talents provided by their creator </li>
          <li> Use their intelligence and ingenuity to exploit the world's
            resources </li>
          <li> Such ideas stemmed from the teaching of the Torah to subdue and
            have dominion over creation </li>
          <li> Control of the natural environment could be seen as a form of
            worship of the creator </li>
          <li> Such thinking will seem abhorrent to modern Jews </li>
          <li> Ideas were developed in the absence of any understanding about
            the potential of humankind to seriously damage and/or destroy the
            natural world </li>
          <li> Jewish teachers have presented important insights into environmental
            ethics which are not only informing the understanding of Jewish adherents
            but are also contributing to dialogues with scientists, economists
            and politicians throughout the world </li>
          <li> Jewish teachers have made enormous contributions to environmental
            awareness yet environmental ethics remains a side issue for many
            Jews </li>
          <li> Across the spectrum of Judaism the greatest activity in the field
            of environmental ethics has come from those belonging to the progressive
            strands such as Reform and Liberal Judaism </li>
          <li> Orthodox Jewish communities give less emphasis given to environmental
            ethics, as indeed is the case with a range of social issues </li>
          <li> Less evidence of environmental activism in the Orthodox strands
            of Judaism in comparison to those at the progressive end of the spectrum. </li>
          <li> Jewish biblical tradition provides significant guidance in the
            field of environmental ethics </li>
          <li> Until recent times there has been little done by the Jewish communities
            in the field of environmental ethics. </li>
          <li> There have always been individual and communities within the Jewish
            tradition who have provided examples of leadership in this field </li>
          <li> It has not been a prominent concern for Jews overall </li>
          <li> Most Jewish communities tacitly recognise the importance of environmental
            ethics </li>
          <li> Yet to become a major focus of day to day life for most Jews and
            their local communities.</li>
        </ul>
	    <h3> Examples of Jewish Environment Groups</h3>
	    <ul class="summary_points">
          <li> In 2002 the UK's largest Jewish organisation, the Board of Deputies,
            launched a joint program with the Jewish environmental organisation
            Noah </li>
          <li> The Noah Project is a UK-based environmental organisation committed
            to raising awareness of environmental issues throughout the Jewish
            community through education, celebration of Jewish festivals and
            practical action </li>
          <li> In the United States the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish
            Life (COEJL) was formed in 1993. </li>
          <li> Engages in environmental education and activism on a number of
            levels as indicated in its mission statement </li>
          <li> "The Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life (COEJL)
            deepens the Jewish community's commitment to the stewardship
            of creation and mobilizes the resources of Jewish life and learning
            to protect the Earth and all its inhabitants </li>
          <li> Within Australia, the small B'nai B'rith Environment Group
            has sought to educate Jewish communities in Australia on environmental
            concerns </li>
          <li> Working publicly since 1997 </li>
          <li>Engaged in a number of practical ventures
