              <p> Individual significance</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> The significance of the synagogue for the individual is that it
		      provides a <b>place to assemble</b> with the community. It
		      also provides a place to <b>study and pray</b>. <b>Rites
		      of passage</b> are celebrated in the synagogue along with the <b>rituals
		      and prayers</b> for holy days and festivals.</p>
		      <p>The synagogue is a place
		        of assembly and as Judaism is a <b>communal religion</b>;
  the most important events take place in the presence of other people. Priority
  is given to the community and its needs and it is incumbent upon the individual
  to make the needs of the <b>community</b> his/her <b>priority</b>.
  What is more, individuals are supported by the community, and this happens
  most effectively when people come together with one another. The synagogue
  is the place where people meet to pray, study, celebrate, mourn, and socialize.
  Today, the synagogue is the hub of the Jewish community, the place where Jews
  come to be together for a variety of reasons, ranging from prayer and study
  to socializing. </p>

            <div class="footnote"><p> Study as worship </p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>The synagogue provides a place to study as <b>study is recognised as a form
of worship</b>. It is believed that through study Jews come to know themselves,
God, and plumb the depths of their relationship with God. It is important that
people study with other people, because when they study in groups, more ideas
are generated and exchanged, new interpretations are born, and learning increases
far beyond what any of person could accomplish sitting alone and studying by
themselves. Educational programs for Jews of all ages -- from infants to the
elderly -- abound in synagogues today because <b>learning is a lifelong
Jewish commitment.</b> </p>

            <div class="footnote">
              <p> Prayer </p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>  Through prayer, both the individual and the community's <b>spiritual
		          needs, obligations and responsibilities</b> are met. The synagogue
		          provides a place to pray as Judaism mandates prayer three times each
		          day. A <b>minyan</b> (quorum of 10 adults) is required
		          to hold a full prayer service because the priority of community is
		          so strong in Judaism. Hence a central meeting place facilitates communal
	          prayer services.</p>
              <p> Prayer, like study, is a <b>mode of worship</b>,
                a way to serve God. Prayer also binds the community together,
                and serves the individual's spiritual needs. Today, the synagogue
                is the locus for most prayer services, with the exception of
                shiva minyanim (prayer services convened in the home of someone
                who is sitting shiva -- the first seven days of mourning following
                the death of a loved one). Since prayer services incorporate
                study and celebration, the three functions of the synagogue reflected
                in the three names, come together.</p>
              <p> Whilst daily prayer can be said anywhere, Jewish tradition
                teaches that certain prayers can only be said in the presence
                of a minyan - a quorum of 10 adult men. There is <b>more
                merit</b> in praying in a group than praying alone. </p>

            <div class="footnote"><p> Bar Mitzvah </p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> In the synagogue service one who <b>blesses the Torah</b> and <b>reads
		          from the Torah</b> must be an adult in the eyes of the community,
		          for the reader is fulfilling a commandment on behalf of all
		          those assembled. The rite of passage known as the <b>Bar or
		          Bat Mitzvah</b> is
		          celebrated in Judaism as a <b>coming of age</b> and the
		          recognition of a young person's movement into the adult world
		          of the Jewish community. It is a joyous occasion and centres
		          around the participant learning to read passages from the Torah. "Bar
		          Mitzvah" and "Bat Mitzvah" mean "one who is of
		          the age of commandment" and it is the status which one attains
		          at the age of 13 and a day. Thus, a young person may bless
		          and read from the Torah only upon reaching this age. This is the
		          reason that the ceremony marking becoming Bat Mitzvah or Bar Mitzvah
	          centres on blessing and reading from the Torah.</p>

            <div class="footnote"><p> Meeting place </p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> The synagogue provides a meeting place for the community to <b>commemorate
		          and participate in holy days</b> and festivals that mark important
		          events in Jewish history. As Judaism is a communal religion
		          the individual is closely connected to community and whilst the individual
		          has a close relationship with God through prayer the community plays
		          an important part in their lives. It is as if the <b>individual</b> is <b>surrounded
		          and supported</b> in their observances at all times by a <b>community
		          of believers</b>. The celebrations for Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur
		          and Sukkoth engage the individual in communal liturgies that
		          support and enrich the faith of Jewish people. Although the celebrations
		          of the festivals extend beyond the synagogue, into the homes
		          and communities of the faithful, the synagogue provides the <b>venue
	          for assembly</b>.</p>

            <div class="footnote"><p> Prayer and repentance </p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>Individuals repent and pray for forgiveness during <b>Rosh Hashanah</b>.
Tradition teaches that on Rosh Hashanah God decides whether or not to write Jewish
people into the <b>Book of Life</b> for the coming year. The decision
is made on the basis of their past deeds. The Book is sealed on <b>Yom Kippur</b>,
giving them Ten Days to repent from their sins in order to be written and sealed
into the Book of Life. Many people find this image terrifying and theologically
problematic. There are two sides to the image, however. One is God's sovereign
power to determine life and death, but the other is the Jewish people's
role in determining their future based on their moral and religious decisions.
They are neither powerless nor all-powerful in determining their futures and
the prayers of Rosh Hashanah reflect this understanding. </p>

            <div class="footnote"><p>Shofar </p></div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> At the synagogue the individual and congregation hear the Shofar.
		        It is a mitzvah (commandment) to hear the shofar blown and its
		        sound reverberates in the Jewish soul. Moses Maimonides, a famous scholar
		        and teacher, wrote that the <b>shofar wakes the people to their
		        responsibilities</b> to God and humanity. It calls them to repent
		        from their sins. In addition, the shofar connects the Jewish
		        people to two occasions through its use: one past and one future. The
		        shofar was blown at Mount Sinai when the Torah was revealed to Israel,
		        the Torah tells us, and tradition holds that it will herald the coming
	          Messianic Age, as well.</p>

              <p> Yom Kippur</p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>Many people spend the <b>entire day</b> in the synagogue
		        on Yom Kippur. When there are breaks in the prayer services,
		        they may use these for <b>study,
meditation, or discussion with others</b>. Yom Kippur is unique in that
the tallit (prayer shawl) is worn for all the prayer services of the day, from
the evening before through Havdalah at the end of the day. Perhaps the most famous
prayer of the entire day is Kol Nidre, which is actually recited prior to Yom
Kippur, before the sun sets. It is chanted dramatically and movingly before a
beit din (court) of three, one of whom is holding a scroll of Torah. Technically,
it is a legal procedure (and hence must be conducted prior to sundown) by which
the members of the congregation are released from unfulfilled vows which will
be made during the coming year, the assumption being that these are vows made
under duress. (Sephardic Jews recited a slightly different text in which they
are released from unfulfilled vows made during the past year.) It derives from
a period in our history when forced conversions were common and many Jews continued
to maintain their religious heritage in secret. Kol Nidre released them from
the vows they had made in duress against their will</p>

            <div class="footnote"><p> Sukkot </p>
            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p> During the remembrance of Sukkot the Torah instructs participants
		        to take up four species in hand to celebrate Sukkot. <em>On the first
		        day you shall take the product of the goodly trees, branches
		        of palm trees, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook, and
		        you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days. </em>[Leviticus
		        23:40] The first three (willow, palm, and myrtle) are bound together
		        and collectively called a <b><em>lulav. </em></b>The fourth
		        is the etrog (citron), a sweet smelling citrus fruit grown in Israel.
		        It is held with the lulav and brought both to the synagogue where it
		        is waved as Hallel is recited. The lulav and etrog are also waved in
		        the sukkah. Ancient Israel was first and foremost an agricultural society
		        and the laws, customs, and rituals described in the Torah reflect this.</p>
