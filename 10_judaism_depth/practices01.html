		      <p> The synagogue is the centre of the Jewish religious community.
		      The Hebrew name for a synagogue is <b>'Beit Knesset'</b> which
		      means House of Assembly. It also goes by the names <b>'Beit
		      Midrash'</b> (House of Study) and <b>'Beit Tefilah'</b> (House
		      of Prayer).</p>
		      <p> The synagogue normally has a well-stocked <b>library</b> of sacred
  Jewish texts for members of the community to study. The synagogue is the place
  where children receive their basic <b>religious education</b> in
  Judaism.</p>
Some <b>ritual practices</b> that take place in synagogues are; marriages,
part of the Shabbat celebration, services for festivals, baby naming ceremonies,
the initiation rites of Bar or Bat Mitzvahs and remembrance ceremonies for the
dead.</div>

		      <p>While there is <b>great variety</b> in the prayers, moods,
		        and liturgies of the various Jewish worship services, there are also
	          structural commonalities which mark them as distinctly Jewish.</p>

		          <p><b>Warm up prayers</b>:<b></b> (These vary
	            depending upon the time of day and occasion. Kabbalat Shabbat
		          is an example of warm-up prayers for the Shabbat evening service.)              </p>

	            <li>
	              <p><b>Shema

                    the Barechu, the Call to Worship, and including prayers on
	              the themes of Creation, Revelation, and Redemption. These prayers
                    establish the common ground of belief and identity of the
		            congregation: We are creatures created by God, Who created the
		            universe; God gave the Jewish people the Torah, which was revealed
		            at Mount Sinai and which serves as their guide; and they look forward
                    to a future redemption -- the messianic age -- which they
		            understand from their past experience of redemption from slavery
		            in Egypt, and which they expect will encompass the world with peace
		            and justice.)</p>
	            </li>
		        <li>
		          <p><b>Amidah</b> (Also known as <i>Ha-Tefillah</i> or <i>Shemona
                      Esrei</i>, the Amidah is the worshiper's opportunity to
                      approach God in private prayer, reciting both the words
                      in the siddur as well as whatever prayers his/her heart
                      may prompt. Because the recitation of this prayer is a
                      central religious obligation, and has always been public
                      by nature, it is often repeated in full by the chazzan
                      (cantor) after the congregation has been given time to
                      recite the prayer privately. The weekday version of the
                      Amidah is considerably longer than the Shabbat/holy day
                      version. Both have a tripartite structure: (1) praises
                      of God; (2) petitions on weekdays, and sanctification of
                      the day on holy days; (3) prayers of thanksgiving. The
                      model for this tripartite structure is how one would approach
                      a powerful ruler -- since God is the sovereign of the universe.
                      On Shabbat, Jews live as if the messianic age has arrived
                      and they have no need to petition God; therefore, they
                      eliminate the petitions and replace them with prayers sanctifying
                      the holy day.)</p>

            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>Torah Service: There is a Torah service only on those occasions
	          when Torah is read: <b>Shabbat and festival mornings, Shabbat
	          and Yom Kippur afternoon</b>. The liturgy surrounding the Torah
	          emphasizes God's sovereignty and the Torah as an extension of God's
	          rule in the lives of Jewish people. This is the time in the service
	          for other public business, as well. Prayers for the sick and those
	          who have died are said while the Torah is open, following the reading
	          a <i>d'var Torah</i> -- explication of the Torah portion -- may
	          be delivered, and other announcements are made.)</p>
	          <p> Musaf: (Musaf, which is a substitute for the additional sacrifice
	            made on Shabbat and other holy days, follows the Torah reading in
              those communities which retain the musaf service.) </p>
	          <p>4 <b>Concluding prayers</b>:
	              The concluding prayers begin with Aleinu, and include Kaddish
	            and a song on Shabbat -- usually Yigdal in the evening and Adon
	            Olam in the morning -- at the end of the service. The Aleinu
	            bespeaks a time when idolatry will have vanished from our world
	            and hence God will be acknowledged by all humanity, sometimes considered
	            a prelude to the messianic age. Kaddish is a prayer which expresses
      the desire for, and belief in, such a time and is recited in memory of
	            those who have died.</p>

            </div>               
		    <div class="text">
		      <p>There are a few significant differences in the way that services
              are conducted in different movements:</p>
		      <ol>
		        <li>In Orthodox, <b>women
                  and men</b> are seated separately;
                      in Progressive and Conservative, all sit together. </li>
	          </ol>
		      <p>NB: There was no 'women's gallery' in Talmudic
                times although the role of women was a passive one. The entire
                education system was designed for boys. The segregation of women
                from men in the synagogue came about in the Middle Ages.</p>
              <p>Children are welcome in the synagogue. They are not be expected
                to sit for hours throughout a long service. It is perfectly acceptable
                for them to walk out to stretch their legs now and then and talk
                with friends. Many synagogues provide babysitting for young children
                and have playgrounds. </p>
              <ol>
                <li value="2">
                  <p>In Orthodox and usually Conservative, everything
                    is in <b>Hebrew</b>.
                      In Progressive most of the service is conducted in <b>English</b>,
                    although they are increasingly using Hebrew. </p>
                </li>
                <li value="3">
                  <p> In Orthodox,
                        the person leading the service has his <b>back
                      to the congregation</b>, and prays facing the same
                      direction as the congregation; in Conservative and Progressive,
                      the person leading the service <b>faces the congregation</b>.                </p>
                </li>
                <li value="4">
                  <p>Conservative and Progressive are rather <b>rigidly structured</b>:
                everybody shows up at the same time, leaves at the same time,
                  and does the same thing at the same time; Orthodox is somewhat
                  more <b>free-form</b>:
                people show up when they show up, catch up to everybody else
                  at their own pace, often do things differently than everybody
                  else. This is terrifying if you don't know what you're doing,
                  but once you've got a handle on the service, it can be more
                  comfortable and inspirational than trying to stay in unison.</p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p> In most synagogues, it is customary for people to cover their heads
		        as a sign of <b>respect for God</b> and acknowledgement that
		        there is something that is "above" humanity in the universe.
		        Head coverings, called kippot, are available in the back of the
		        sanctuary. Those who are over the age of 13 often wear a tallit (prayer
		        shawl) which has special ritual fringes (called tzitzit) on the corners.
		        The Torah commands Jews to wear fringes on the corners of their garments
		        as a reminder of God's commandments. Wearing the tallit helps
		        the worshiper concentrate better on prayer. Non-Jewish visitors do
	          not wear the tallit.</p>

		      <p>The <b>Holy Ark</b> (Aron Ha-kodesh) is on the eastern wall.
		        The ark of the modern synagogue is reminiscent of the ark in which
		        the Israelites kept the Torah, which according to tradition God gave
		        to Moses on Mount Sinai. It contains the <b>Sifrei Torah</b>,
		        parchment scrolls on which the Torah (Five Books of Moses, also known
		        as the Chumash or Pentateuch) is written. The Ark resembles a closet
	          or cabinet has a curtain (parochet) and often doors, as well.</p>

		    <div class="text">
		      <p> An <b>eternal Light</b> (Ner Tamid) hangs above the ark
		        in every synagogue. It is often associated with the menorah,
		        the seven-branched lamp stand which stood in front of the Temple in
		        Jerusalem. It is associated with the continuously burning incense altar
		        which stood in front of the ark. The Jewish sages interpreted the Ner
		        Tamid as a symbol of <b>God's
		        eternal and imminent presence</b> in Jewish communities and the
		        people's lives. The Ner Tamid are mostly fuelled by gas and electricity
	          today and are never turned off.</p>

		      <p>The Menorah: The <b>seven-branched lampstand</b> which stood
	          in the Temple in Jerusalem is symbolized in many modern sanctuaries
	          by the menorah. The seven branches, mirroring the seven days in
	          a week (the Six Days of Creation plus the Sabbath) reflect Creation
	          itself and thereby bespeak the Creator.              </p>
	          <p> The tradition of <b>Tzedekah</b> (righteousness)
                  is a fundamental part of Jewish living. There are many forms
                  of righteous behaviour, but giving charity is among the most
                  basic. <b>Charity is compulsory</b> in the Jewish
                  tradition, because the poor need it. Many synagogues have a
                  Tzedekah boxes to enable people who come to worship, study
                  and celebrate to fulfil the precept of righteousness. A Tzedekah
                  box can take any form from an empty coffee jar to an artistic
                  object.The <b>Hazzan</b> (cantor)
                  is specially trained in the art of Jewish music and liturgy
                  for this role. In many congregations, the cantor is professionally
                  trained and studies a broad pallet of Jewish subjects in addition
                  to those mentioned above, and does a good deal of teaching,
                  counselling, and life-cycle officiation in addition to leading
                  the community in prayer.</p>

		        sure that the Torah Service runs smoothly. These people are the gabbaim.
		        It is their job to <b>call people to the Torah</b> for their

		        the Torah, and provide correction if a mistake is made, recite the
		        Mi Sheberach for those who have had an aliyah, and see to the mechanics

		        This person will then turn around so that the side of the scroll with

		        everyone assembled to <b>view the scroll</b>,
since not everyone received the honour of an aliyah, thereby enabling them to
peer into the scroll that morning. It is traditional to show a minimum of three
columns of writing, including the portion read that morning. The honour of lifting
the Torah is called hagbahah sits in a chair on the bima and the another person,
who is being honoured with the gelilah, the rolling and dressing of the scroll,

		      <p> In most congregations, the <b>Torah is chanted</b> according
              to a musical system called trop which can found in many printed
              editions of the Torah. While the notation for the text is, by and
              large, standardized, there are many different <b>musical systems</b> employed
              for chanting the Torah. In other words, there is general agreement
              about the specific trop symbols which apply to the words of the
              Torah, but many different tunes, and versions of tunes, by which
              the trop are sung. In some congregations, the Torah is either read
              without chanting, or read in Hebrew accompanied by a simultaneous
              translation.</p>
              <p></p>
It is challenging to learn to learn to read from a Sefer Torah, which

		      <p>The word aliyah means <b>"ascending"</b> and
              refers to the act of going up to the Torah (which is read from
              the bima on a level higher than that of the congregation, signifying
              its holiness) and reciting the blessing over the Torah. Any adult

  the scroll</b> and point to where s/he will begin reading. The person
  called to the Torah takes the tzitzit of the tallit and touches them to the
  first word to be read and kisses the tzitzit. The Torah will then be <b>rolled,
  closed</b> and,
  in many congregations, <b>covered</b>. The one blessing the Torah
  holds the wooden rollers and recites the first blessing. After the reading
  completes reading the section for that aliyah, the reader will point out the
  last word read to the person who is blessing the Torah, who again takes the
  tzitzit, touches the last word, and kisses the tzitzit. The scroll is again
  rolled closed, and the person reciting the blessing holds the wooden rollers

		      <p>A <b>printed edition of the Torah</b>, called the chumash,
              is used when the Torah is read, so that the congregation can follow
              along with the reading. Most Chumashim (plural of chumash) have
              the Hebrew text with the English translation printed in the facing
              columns.              </p>
              <p> Both the siddur and the chumash are considered sifrei kodesh
                (holy books) because they contain the Tetragrammaton (the ineffable
                name of God). They should never be placed on the floor, left
                sitting open or unattended on the chair. If a volume is dropped
                accidentally, it is customary to pick it up and kiss it. </p>

		        many rabbis serve as administrators of their synagogues, represent
		        the congregation to the community, officiate at life-cycle events,
		        and serve as Jewish legal decisors and render decisions concerning
	          Jewish legal matters that come before them.</p>
