	                                that of Synagogue attendance. The synagogue
	                                is the center of every religious Jewish community
	                                and provides a place for assembly, study
	                                and prayer. The individual meets with other
	                                members of the congregation to join in liturgies
	                                for Shabbat and holy days. The services follow
	                                a format that involves set prayers such as Kabbalat
	                                Shabbat and the recitation of the Shema.
	                                A Hazzan (cantor) often leads the prayers. Children
	                                are always welcome at the synagogue. Different
	                                sects within Judaism have slightly different
	                                practices within a service. For example, in
	                                Orthodox synagogues women and men sit separately
	                                and in Progressive and Conservative synagogues
	                                they sit together.</p>

	                                <p> The synagogue service provides adherents
	                                  with a place to assemble, study and pray.

	                                  to learn about their tradition. Teaching and
	                                  learning about the faith is highly valued
	                                  in Judaism and is an ancient practice that
	                                  supports the tradition. The synagogue provides
	                                  a place for the community to pray individually
	                                  and as part of a faith community. Communal

	                                  and enriches, adherents' lives. Prayers
	                                  of mourning and memorials for the dead enable
	                                  members of the congregation to express grief
                                    and to find comfort surrounded by others. </p>

	                                  Tefilah'. Central to Judaism is the
	                                  belief that they were a chosen people bound
	                                  by a covenant to God. The mitzvot were
	                                  given to the ancient children of Israel
	                                  through the prophets by God. The Torah contains
	                                  the mtizvot and is read at the synagogue.
	                                  Adherents of Judaism listen to and read

	                                  services and continue to learn about their
	                                  faith. The Torah is housed in the synagogue
	                                  in the ark as it is a sacred and holy text
	                                  that Jews believe is the word of God in written
	                                  form. The ark in the synagogue is a symbolic
	                                  reminder of the original ark of the covenant
	                                  that the patriarch Moses had the people build
	                                  when they were in the desert. The rite of
	                                  passage known as the Bar Mitzvah and the Bat
	                                  Mitzvat is the coming of age ceremony for
	                                  young Jewish boys and girls. The ceremony
	                                  is held in the synagogue and includes the
	                                  initiate reading from the Torah in the company
	                                  of the community. The celebration of the entry

	                                  are also commemorated in the synagogue with
	                                  special services. The events form part of
	                                  the liturgical calendar that brings to mind
	                                  the stories of exile, exodus, return and freedom
	                                  that have been the lived experience of many
	                                  Jewish people over the centuries. Individual
	                                  prayer and communal prayers are conducted
	                                  in the synagogue with certain prayers such
	                                  as the Shema recited as a declaration of the
	                                  faith of Jewish people and a reaffirmation
	                                  of the covenantal promise. The synagogue serves
	                                  as an important centre for adherents of Judaism
	                                  that stands as a symbol of their ongoing communal

	                                <p> Significant ritual practices that take place
	                                  in synagogues include; a service as part of
	                                  the Shabbat celebration, liturgies and prayers
	                                  for festivals, the initiation rites of Bar
	                                  or Bat Mitzvahs, baby naming ceremonies, marriages
	                                  and remembrance ceremonies for the dead.</p>
	                                <p> The synagogue is a place of assembly and
	                                  as Judaism is a communal religion; the most
	                                  important events take place in the presence
	                                  of other people. Priority is given to the
	                                  community and its needs and it is incumbent
	                                  upon the individual to make the needs of the
	                                  community his or her priority. What is more,
	                                  individuals are supported by the community,
	                                  and this happens most effectively when people
	                                  come together with one another.</p>
	                                <p> The synagogue services include the reading
	                                  of the Torah - the sacred text central
	                                  to Judiasm. The Torah is read weekly in synagogues
	                                  on Shabbat morning, as well as on Mondays
	                                  and Thursdays, and on holy days and festivals.
	                                  It is divided into parshiot (portions) which
	                                  are read consecutively, each week, throughout
	                                  the year. On certain days, because of festivals
	                                  or an upcoming holiday, special readings supplant
	                                  the weekly reading. The cycle then recommences
	                                  the following week. The Torah contains the
	                                  mitzvot that guide the lives of people within
	                                  the congregation and they are read in the
	                                  services and expounded upon by the Rabbi in
	                                  the form of homilies. Members of the community
	                                  also meet to discuss Torah and this provides
	                                  important support and guidence for the faithful.</p>
	                                <p> The Torah is housed in the ark, a reminder
	                                  of the original Ark of the Covenant that Moses
	                                  and the children of Israel built whilst in
	                                  the desert. The ceremony that surropunds the
	                                  reading of the Torah reveals the special honour
	                                  given to the text and signifies the value
	                                  placed on the word of God. The symbolism connects
	                                  the beleivers to their ancient traditions
	                                  and continues the promises made by the Jewish
	                                  people in their covenant with God.</p>
	                                <p> Other ceremonies held in the synagogue include
	                                  the reite of passage known as Bat Mitzvah
	                                  and Bar Mitzvah, the entry of adolescent children
	                                  into the adult community. Reading the Torah
	                                  surrounded by the congregation is an important
	                                  part of the ritual that marks the acceptance
	                                  of responsibility to contribute as a son or
	                                  daughter of the commandments - mitzvah and
	                                  the public acknowledgement of inclusion in
	                                  the Jewish faith.</p>
	                                Festivals such as Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur
	                                are commemorated in the synagogue and are
	                                important events in the liturgical cycle of
	                                Judaism. They provide opportunities for spiritual
	                                renewal and recommitment for individuals and
	                                the whole community. They also the recall great
	                                events in Jewish history and symbolise the ongoing
	                                relationship that the Jewish people have
	                                with God. Opportunities for repentance, forgiveness,
	                                mourning, comfort and praise exist within
	                                the litugies and services held in the synagogue.
	                                The congregation is able to pray communal
	                                prayers and individually. The Shema prayer that
	                                affirms the beliefs central to Judaism is recited
	                                along with special prayers for the different
	                                occasions. The synagogue provides a place that
	                                the community can meet so as to worship and
        praise God as a covenanted people.<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
