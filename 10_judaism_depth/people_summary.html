		  <h3>Message/Teaching</h3>
          <ul class="summary_points">
            <li>Commentary on the Mishnah - explained the meaning of
              each Mishnah in a simple, systematic and ordered way. </li>
          <li> The Commentary on the Mishnah explained the link between learning
            Torah and putting it into practice. </li>
          <li> Within this Commentary Maimonides formulated the thirteen principles
            of faith which is recognised as a creed for Judaism. </li>
          <li> Commentary on the Mishnah was written in Arabic - easily accessible
            to Jews living in Muslim areas. </li>
          <li> Mishneh Torah - code of Jewish law - fourteen books written in
            Hebrew - in a style easily read and understood. </li>
          <li> The Mishneh Torah, is a comprehensive guide to Jewish law without
            the need for study of Talmud. </li>
          <li> Does not include debate, discussion, minority opinion etc as found
            in Talmud. </li>
          <li> Many Jews felt it would lead to people no longer studying Talmud. </li>
          <li> Mishneh Torah contained - Book of Knowledge - concerning belief
            in God, idolatry, repentance and the study of Torah. Other 13 books
            detail Jewish ritual and civil laws e.g. blessings, circumcision,
            holy days, relationships, dietary laws and ethics. </li>
          <li> Conclusion of Mishneh Torah deals with interpretation of the notion
            of messiah (Mashiah). Maimonides saw coming of messiah as a time
            of peace and prosperity free from wars and oppression - free to study
            Torah in preparation for the life to come. </li>
          <li> Guide of the Perplexed (Moreh Nevuchim) - philosophical work attempting
            to reconcile the Jewish concept of God with the Aristotelian view
            of God. </li>
          <li> Deals with anthropomorphisms - Maimonides concluded that
            God should not be taken literally as described eg. Hand of god. </li>
          <li> Maimonides argued in the Guide for the Perplexed that if taking
            the bible literally contravened reason then it should not be taken
            literally. </li>
          <li> In the Guide for the Perplexed Maimonides puts forward the position
            that religious belief should be logical and open to intellectual
            debate. </li>
          <li> In the Guide for the Perplexed Maimonides concludes that it is
            possible to acquire knowledge of God through the mind. </li>
          <li> Studying Torah helped to attain a greater knowledge of God in
            the philosophical sense. </li>
          <li> However, there is also a limit to knowledge of God that a person
            could attain. </li>
          <li> Third part of Guide of the Perplexed deals with providing reasons
            for the mitzvot which may be seen as unreasonable. </li>
          <li> Guide - extremely difficult work - written in Arabic - intended
            for students of Aristotelian philosophy who were confused by apparent
            contradictions between philosophy and the Jewish religion.</li>
