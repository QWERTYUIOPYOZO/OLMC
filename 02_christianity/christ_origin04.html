								<div class="footnote">Jesus movement and the New Testament period </div>                                     
								<div class="text">There are two major periods within the history of the early Church. The death of Jesus marks the beginning of the <b>Jesus movement</b> which lasted approximately from 30-60 CE. The <b>New Testament</b> period which followed this is quite extensive and lasted from approximately 45-110 CE. The characteristics of the Church changed quite considerably during this latter period. There are two divisions within the New Testament period, firstly the period of the Proto-Pauline letters which is followed by the period of the Deutero-Pauline letters. A considerable variety existed in the characteristics of these early Christian Churches due to the absence of precedent and a lack of centralised leadership stemming from the infancy of the Christian movement.</p>

							<div class="footnote">Characteristics of the Jesus movement </div>                                     
							<div class="text">The term 'Jesus movement' describes a period where the infant Christian community saw itself as a sect which existed within the Jewish tradition. These earliest communities were characterised by their gender inclusive nature and <b>eschatological vision</b>, that is, they believed that they were living in the last days before the <b>Parousia</b>, the second coming of Christ. As a result little emphasis was given to laying down the infrastructure of the movement. So for the first forty years after Jesus' death the Churches were scattered in different areas and existed without a centralised code of Christian behaviour and practice.

							<div class="footnote">Paul and Peter </div>                                     
									<div class="text">Paul and Peter were the two most significant leaders
									  in the early Church. Small groups of Palestinian Jews followed Jesus
									  through the preachings of Peter. Larger groups of <b>Diaspora</b> Hellenistic
									  Jews and <strong>Gentile</strong> Christians
									  followed Jesus through the preachings of
									  Paul. 


Paul is regarded by Brendon Byrne and others as the second founder of Christianity.

Where Jesus set down the foundational message of Christianity
									  concerning the reign of God, Paul helped
									  to set up the structure of this new religion and hence confirm the
									  status of Christianity vis-à-vis
									  Judaism. This was because Paul recognised that Jesus' message was
									  not intended solely for people of the Jewish faith and consequently
									  he utilised Hellenistic philosophy to help communicate many of Jesus'
									  ideas. This included the introduction of the Pauline theology of salvation,
									  justification and law into Christian life and belief.

									<div class="footnote">Divisions in the early Church </div>                                     
									<div class="text">The existence of a varied community which contained Jewish Christians of <strong>Palestinian background</strong>, Jewish Christians of <strong>Hellenistic background</strong> and <strong>Gentile Christians</strong> in the period of the early Church was a source of disagreement and conflict. In fact one of the most important controversies in the early Church arose because the original Jewish nature of the Christian Church was challenged by the <strong>conversion of the Gentiles</strong>. The debate regarding the inclusion of the Gentiles resulted in the formation of the <strong>Council of Jerusalem</strong> in 49 CE. This amounted to an early attempt to overcome differences within the Church. Paul's argument that Gentiles do not need to become Jews and undergo circumcision in order to become Christians prevailed at this council. Despite this formal solution, divisions of this nature continued for some time. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE the Pauline group of Diaspora Jewish converts to Christianity and the Gentile Christians became more closely 										knit. At the same time as the Palestinian group fragmented.

								 <div class="footnote">Reasons for the formalisation of the early Church </div>                                     
									<div class="text">The Christian Churches became more formalised from 70 CE onwards. This was the result of unforeseen events which significantly changed the character of early Church communities. The <strong>delay of the Parousia</strong>, the second coming of Christ and the <strong>death of the Apostles</strong> meant that there was a need to institutionalise the charism of the movement by introducing more regulated practices. This formalisation of the Christian identity meant that Christianity was increasingly seen as a distinct and separate religion from Judaism. This was partly because during this period the Christian Churches came into great <strong>conflict with Judaism</strong>.

									<div class="content2">
									<div class="footnote">Conflict with Judaism </div>                                     
									<div class="text"> Jews persecuted Christians because they were seen
									  as a threat to the purity of Judaism, for
									  three main reasons: firstly, Christians
									  spoke of and emulated Jesus, as God which made the Christians sound
									  like they were <strong>polytheistic</strong>.
									  Secondly, Christians and Jews could not
									  interact as Christians were not seen as <strong>ritually
									  pure</strong> due to their association with the Gentiles. Thirdly
									  the Christians had refused to support the
									  Jews in their attempts to overthrow the
									  Roman occupation.</div>

								<div class="content2">
									<div class="footnote">Roman persecution </div>                                     
									<div class="text">The continued but sporadic <strong>persecution of Christians</strong> by the Romans during the second and third centuries meant that secret signs and meeting places had to be devised for the protection of Christians. The Romans persecuted the Christians because they appeared to be neglectful citizens in that they were pacifists who refused to join the army during a war ravaged age and because they refused to serve on the judiciary. The Christian monotheistic practice also offended Roman sensibilities as Romans worshipped <strong>many gods</strong>. On top of this there were rumours that Christians were incestuous and cannibalistic. These rumours developed as a result of the secretive nature of the Eucharistic celebrations.

									<div class="footnote">Constantine</div>                                     
									<div class="text">Prior to the 3rd century CE, Christians occupied a small, insignificant part of society. The efforts of <strong>Constantine</strong> in the fourth century meant that Christianity became a powerful and dominant religion. Constantine who is typically known as the founder of Christendom helped the religion to gain the <strong>privileges, wealth and influence</strong> that it did not previously have during the age of persecutions.
