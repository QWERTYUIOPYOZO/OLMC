								<div class="footnote">Bible is the normative for Christianity</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The Bible, which is a collection of books, is of critical importance in Christianity. It is <strong>normative for Christianity</strong> as it identifies the key beliefs and determines ethical, legal, ritual and spiritual foundations. Thus Christianity is commonly known as a religion of the book, as is Judaism and Islam. The Bible is foundational to Christianity because the Bible is regarded as the <strong>word of God</strong>.  
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Nature of the sacred text</div>                                     
								<div class="text">For Christians the Bible includes the <strong>Old Testament</strong> and the <strong>New Testament</strong>. The Old Testament, sometimes referred to as the Hebrew Scriptures, is very similar to the Jewish sacred text the Tenak. The Old Testament can be roughly divided into four sections. The first five books are known as the <strong>Pentateuch</strong>. The second group of books, the <strong>Historical books</strong>, are books with an historical character. Thirdly there is a collection of the writings of the <strong>Prophets</strong> and finally other writings such as the Psalms and Proverbs which are broadly classified as <strong>Wisdom literature</strong>. The New Testament contains four <strong>Gospels</strong>, an account of the development of the early Church knows as the <strong>Acts of the Apostles</strong>, a series of <strong>letters to Churches or individuals</strong> written by Paul and other early Church leaders and an apocalyptic work called the book of <strong>Revelation</strong> or the book of the Apocalypse. 
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Deutero Canonical or Apocryphal books</div>                                     
								<div class="text">All books of the New Testament and the vast majority
								  of Old Testament books are accepted by all
								  Christian groups and thereby are considered
								  as part of the <strong>canon
								  of scripture</strong>.
								  A small number of books in the Old Testament
								  have a <strong>disputed
								  status</strong> in
								  the canon. 


These books, written in Greek in the late Old Testament period, are accepted
by Catholic and Orthodox Christians, however are regarded as <strong>Deutero
Canonical </strong> books by some other Christian denominations. This means belonging
to a second canon or second collection. In Protestant groups these books are
not accepted as part of the canon of scripture and are referred to as apocryphal
books or apocrypha. These books are often found in bibles but designated as Deutero
Canonical or <strong>Apocryphal</strong> books.</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Bible is inspired by God</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Christians believe that the Bible is <strong>inspired by God</strong> and thus carries the authority of God. Consequently, the Bible provides a special connection
								  between God and humans and provides human beings with deep spiritual
								  insight into their religion. The belief that the Bible is inspired
								  by God is a belief <strong>held in common by all Christians</strong>, yet, the understanding of this inspiration differs from group to group. Some Christians believe the inspiration of scripture amounts to God dictating a word for word account which was then recorded and passed on in the Christian communities. Such beliefs are in the realm of a fundamentalist understanding which also insists that every aspect and every detail of the bible must be held to be true in a literal sense. Such an understanding is likely to be found among the evangelical groups within Protestantism.
								<p>Other Christian groups understand that the inspiration of the Holy Spirit came in and through the <strong>human insights and understanding</strong> of the authors of the text who were reflecting and passing on the faith of their community. In this way the writers were indeed authors in the true sense of the word and brought their own unique gifts to the task of writing. In and through this human activity, the inspiration of the Spirit is present and the result is a sacred texts which fully and profoundly expresses the <strong>revelation of God</strong>. This understanding affirms that the Bible carries all that is <strong>necessary for human salvation</strong> but does not require that the reader accept every aspect in a literal sense. This understanding is found among the Catholic and Orthodox strands of Christianity as well as the High Church Anglicans and some Protestant denominations
   								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Bible contains salvation history</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The Bible depicts the hand of God intervening in human history. In other words, the Bible contains the <strong>salvation history</strong> from the origins of <strong>creation</strong> through the covenant with the people of Israel, the teaching of the <strong>prophets</strong> and finally the new covenant inaugurated through the life and <strong>ministry of Jesus</strong>.
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Model for Christian life action</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Christianity draws many of its practices and teachings from the Bible. The Bible conveys an understanding of a <strong>model of life</strong> and action. These actions are based on broad principles rather than specific teachings that outline what is required of Christians on a day to day basis. In this way, the Bible is a source of unity for Christians as it provides a link to a <strong>communal religious heritage</strong>. Since the Bible provides a model for action the fundamental source of <strong>ethical guidance</strong> is derived from the Bible and in particular the <strong>New Testament</strong> which contains the four Gospels. Thus the Bible provide guidance for individual Christians as well as for Christian communities.  
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Different application of the Bible across the spectrum of Christianity</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The Bible, while being of critical and <strong>equal
								    importance</strong> to all Christian denominations, is nevertheless <strong>used
								    differently</strong> across the spectrum of denominations. The Catholic
								    and Orthodox denominations believe that the
								    revelation of God comes through scripture<strong> in
								    the light</strong> <strong>of Tradition</strong>. In other words, tradition or Church
								    teaching illuminates the meaning of scripture.
								    In contrast, Protestants do not place the
								    same emphasis on tradition as a means of
								    illuminating the meaning of the sacred text
								    because. That is, the teaching authority of the Church
								    is seen as relevant, but they are more directly
								    related to Biblical teaching. Instead, Protestants
								    reaffirm the concept of <strong>sola
								    scriptura</strong> which means 'scripture alone', in using a more
								    direct application of the Bible. Thus, personal
								    conscience and <strong>individual
								    interpretation of the Biblical texts</strong> are more pronounced
								    in Protestant Churches. 
								    <p>Within Protestantism, there are also variations regarding the application of the Bible. High Church Anglicans adopt a position that is similar to the Catholic and Orthodox stance in their belief that scripture and tradition go hand in hand. Low Church Anglicans embrace a more fundamentalist approach to the Bible.      
								<p>Stemming from its significant impact on <strong>beliefs</strong> the Bible also has a vital role in determining the <strong>rituals</strong> and <strong>practical dimensions</strong> of Christianity. The Bible for example <strong>underpins study</strong> from a theological perspective. It provides guidelines for <strong>ritual, prayer and worship</strong>, the latter being strongly based on scripture.
