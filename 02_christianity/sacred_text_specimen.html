									<p><strong>Explain the importance of the Bible in the Christian tradition (20 marks)</strong></p> 											
											<h2>Sample Responses</h2>
											<p><strong>Explain the importance of the Bible in the Christian tradition</strong></p>
											<p>The sacred text of Christianity, the Bible, is clearly foundational to the tradition, as Christianity is commonly known as a religion of the book. The Bible is a collection of books, divided into two main sections, the Old Testament and the New Testament. The importance of the Bible for the Christian tradition cannot be underestimated as the Bible is normative for Christianity. It indicates the key beliefs and determines the ethical, legal, ritual and spiritual foundations. 
											<p>The Bible describes the relationship between God and humankind as it contains the salvation history, that is, the account of God's intervention in human history from the moment of creation, culminating in the life and ministry of Jesus. The Bible is believed to mirror this intimate connection between God and humankind as the Bible is seen to be inspired by God. Consequently, Christianity draws many of its practices and beliefs from the Bible. 
											<p>Whilst the Bible is the foundational text for all Christian denominations, the way in which the Bible is interpreted and applied to specific situations differs across the spectrum of Christianity. This divergence of opinion stems from the key issue of whether the denomination believes that the teaching authority of the Church should be used to illuminate the meaning of the Bible and thus is considered an important adjunct to the Bible. 
											<p>The books in the Bible are divided into two main collections, the Old Testament also known as the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament. Since Christianity branched off from its parent religion Judaism, it is not surprising to find that the Old Testament is similar to the Jewish sacred text, the Tenach. The Old Testament can be further divided into four key parts: firstly the Pentateuch, followed by books with a historical character, then the writings of the Prophets and finally the Wisdom Literature. The New Testament can also be loosely divided into 4 sections: the four Gospels, followed by the Acts of the Apostles, a series of letters to Churches and individuals written mainly by Paul and finally the book of Revelation, an apocalyptic work. The official canon of scripture is mostly undisputed, however, there are a small minority of books known as the Deutero Canonical or Apocryphal books contained in the Old Testament which have a disputed status in the canon. These books are accepted by 												the Catholic and Orthodox denominations, however, they are not accepted by Protestant groups. 
											<p>The first reason why the Bible is important in the Christian tradition is because the Bible is considered to be the word of God as it is inspired by God. Thus, the Bible carries with it the authority of God, in illuminating the omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient nature of God, and records the intimate relationship between God and human kind. The Bible is the account of God's intervention in human history from the dawn of creation and reaching its highpoint in the life and ministry of Jesus. This account is known as salvation history. Since the Bible carries with it the authority of God it provides human beings with rich spiritual insights into their religion. 
											<p>The exact nature of the inspiration is a matter of dispute amongst the different Christian denominations. Nevertheless, the belief that the Bible is the inspired word of God is universally accepted across the spectrum of Christian denominations. Fundamentalist Christians interpret Biblical inspiration in a literal sense in that the inspiration of scripture amounts to God dictating a word for word account which was then recorded and passed on in the Christian communities. As a consequence they construe the meaning of the scriptures in a literal sense by taking the exact words of the Bible at face value. This type of interpretation of the Bible is prevalent among the evangelical groups within Protestantism. 
											<p>Catholic and Orthodox denominations, together with High Church Anglicans and some Protestant denominations accept that the Bible is not dictated by God in a literal sense. Rather, they believe that the spirit of God inspired human beings who received insight in their understanding of God. Subsequently, these authors recorded their enlightened reflections on God as a way of passing on their faith to the community. In other words, a greater role is given to human agency as the inspired authors brought their own unique gifts to the task of writing. In and through this human activity, the inspiration of the Spirit is present and thus the sacred texts fully express the revelation of God. The Bible contains all that is necessary for human salvation. Since the Bible is not a literal transcript of God's words, the reader therefore does not need to take each word at face value. 
											<p>Considering the importance of the Bible as it carries the authority of God in recording salvation history it is therefore no surprise that the Bible is normative for Christianity. In other words, it conveys key beliefs and determines the practical application of the text to the legal, ethical and ritual dimensions. And since the Bible is normative for diverse communities the Bible is also a source of unity for Christians as it provides a link to a common religious heritage. For example, the Bible provides a general ethical framework for life based on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. The Bible generally provides overall ethical principles which guide Christians rather than specific laws which outline what is required of Christians on a day to day basis.  
											<p>The Bible which sets out the Christian doctrinal system also determines the practical dimension of Christianity that is the ritual aspect of Christianity. The Bible is seen to provide guidelines for ritual, prayer and worship. Furthermore, the Bible underpins theological studies. From this, a Christian community comes to an understanding of how people within the tradition should be treated. 
											<p>The Bible therefore is clearly of great importance for all Christian denominations. The application of the Bible differs however across the spectrum of Christian denominations. The factor which divides Catholic and Orthodox communities on the one hand and Protestant groups on the other, is the extent to which they accept the teaching of Church authority as a way of interpreting the scripture. Catholic and Orthodox denominations believe that the tradition illuminates the meaning of scripture in that the revelation of God comes through scripture in the light of tradition. Protestant denominations place less emphasis the idea of the teaching authority of the Church in favour of a more direct application of the Bible. This view stems from the writings of Luther in the 16th century who taught that the only source Christians should turn to for inspiration is the Bible. The belief that the Bible is the only source of authority is termed "sola scriptura" or scripture alone. As Protestant denominations 												apply the Bible more directly to specific situations the role of personal conscience and individual interpretation is likewise more pronounced in Protestant denominations. The belief in sola scripture is particularly strong amongst evangelical Protestants. High Church Anglicans on the other hand accept a doctrinal position that is more closely aligned to the Catholic and Orthodox positions in their belief that tradition and scripture go hand in hand. 
											<p>In conclusion, it is clear that the Bible is of critical importance for all Christian denominations and is normative for the Christian tradition. The importance of the Bible can be traced back to the belief that the Bible is the word of God as it is inspired by the Holy Spirit. The Bible which contains salvation history that sets out the relationship between God and humankind lay down the core beliefs of Christianity. From this, flows the practical dimension of Christianity as the Bible also sets down rituals, prayers and ways of worship. The Bible, therefore, is clearly of utmost importance for the Christian tradition. The application of the Bible differs, however, across the spectrum of Christian denominations, depending on the emphasis given to the teaching authority of the Church. Despite these differences all denominations accept the view that the Bible is of critical importance to the Christian tradition.</p>
