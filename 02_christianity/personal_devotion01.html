									<h1>Content Description </h1>
									<p>Christians are called to be people of prayer following the example of Jesus. Prayer was at the heart of the ministry of Jesus and those who follow Jesus seek to also live a life of prayer.
								  <p>All Christian denominations have communal prayer rituals which play a very significant role in their tradition. The most important of these is the Sabbath or Sunday service which is the focal point for the life of the community. Beyond the communal times of prayer there are a wide range of personal prayer forms which are undertaken by Christians in various denominations.
								  <h2>Traditional and Formal Prayers</h2>
										<p>Throughout Christian history, various people have composed prayers which have become widely used. Many of these prayers recite or adapt biblical texts. Such traditional prayers cover a wide range of occasions and needs. 
										</p>
								<div class="content2">
								<h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Importance of the Lord's prayer</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The best known and most widely used of these prayers
								  is the <strong>Lord's Prayer</strong> also known as the <strong>Our
								  Father</strong>.
								  This prayer is taken from the occasion in the
								  gospel where the disciples ask Jesus to teach
								  them to pray.(Luke 11:1 &amp; Matthew 6:9-15) Jesus' response is known
								  as the Lord's Prayer. It is used throughout <strong>all
								  Christian denominations</strong> and is commonly included in liturgy
								  as well as <strong>personal prayer</strong>.  
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Lord's Prayer provides outline for an approach to prayer</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The Lord's Prayer has also been analysed and presented as an outline for an <strong>approach to prayer</strong>. This analysis reveals different aspects to the prayer which can be seen to represent different types of prayer. For example the word "hallowed be thy name" can be seen to represent <strong>praise</strong>. "Give us this day our daily bread" can be seen to stand for prayers of <strong>petition</strong>. "Forgive us our trespasses" can be seen to indicate a prayer of <strong>repentance</strong>.  In this way the Lord's prayer can also be used as an outline indicating the different types of prayer which Christians are taught to use.
								</div> 
								<h2>The Rosary</h2>
								<div class="footnote"></div>                                     
								<div class="text">Another traditional prayer which is well known in the <strong>Catholic
								    community</strong> is the Rosary. This is another prayer which draws
								    heavily on <strong>biblical texts</strong>. The Rosary is organised
								    into 5 decades each containing 10 recitations
								    of the prayer known as the "Hail Mary". Each decade is begun with
								    the Lord's prayer and concludes with a short
								    prayer of praise known as the "Glory Be".
								    In the course of each decade of the Rosary,
								    the person praying is encouraged to <strong>meditate</strong> on
								    one of the "mysteries".
								  These are organised into four groups and are
								    based on events in the life of Jesus. 
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Intention of the Rosary</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The intention of the Rosary is that a person can meditate on the events of the <strong>life of Jesus</strong> from the <strong>perspective of Mary</strong> the mother of Jesus. This approach takes its inspiration from the biblical text where Mary is described as pondering events in her heart (Luke 3:51). 
								<p>The Rosary is often prayed communally, however, it is also a widely used form of personal prayer.
 								</div> 
								<h2>The Divine Office</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Use of the Divine Office in religious communities</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Another form of traditional prayer commonly found in the Catholic and Orthodox traditions is the <strong>prayer of the Church</strong> or the Divine Office. The Divine Office has its origins and basis in the life of religious communities. It developed in conjunction with the monastic rule of <strong>Benedict of Nursia</strong>. The rule of Benedict has been the most influential rule governing religious life.
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Use of the Divine Office in personal prayer</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Beyond its use in religious communities, the Divine Office is also widely used as a <strong>personal prayer</strong> and has particular appeal to people who wish to pray in conjunction with members of religious communities and to share in a prayer being offered throughout that day by Christians in <strong>all parts of the world</strong>.
															 
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Divine office is based on scripture</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The Divine Office is almost entirely based on <strong>scriptural texts</strong>. It is based very strongly in the <strong>praying of the Psalms</strong> which forms the heart of the prayer. It also includes the Lord's prayer, the Canticle of Zechariah also know as the Benedictus (Luke 1:68-79), the Canticle of Mary also known as the Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55) and the Canticle of Simeon also known as the Nunc Dimittis (Luke 2:29-32). The Divine Office also includes a <strong>scripture reading</strong> and <strong>prayers of intercession</strong>.
															 
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Timing of the Divine office </div>                                     
								<div class="text">The Divine Office is <strong>organised daily</strong> into a number of times of prayer to mark the day from early in the morning until late at night. Most people who use the Divine Office are likely to only use the <strong>morning and evening</strong> <strong>prayer</strong> and perhaps the <strong>night prayer</strong> rather than the prayer for the different hours of the day.
								<p>The Divine Office follows a cycle which connects to the Liturgical seasons of the year and also includes prayers for feast days.
								</div>
								<h2>Informal and Spontaneous Prayer</h2>
								<p>Christians across a range of denominations use a variety of informal and spontaneous forms of prayer for different occasions and times.</p> 
							 <h2>Morning and Evening Prayer</h2>
							 <div class="footnote">Purpose fo morning and everning prayer </div>                                     
								<div class="text">Christians have been traditionally taught to <strong>begin and end each day with prayer</strong> and accordingly the pattern of <strong>morning and everning prayer</strong> is widely followed.  Typically a morning prayer is one of <strong>dedication to God</strong>.  It oftern also includes petitions relating to enents int he coming day or pressing matters of concern.  Evening prayer or night prayer is typicall a prayer of <strong>thansgiving for God's providence</strong> during the day.  It also oftern includes <strong>prayers of blessing</strong> for family and other loved ones.
								  <p>Some Christians would make use of prayers prepared for these purposes while others will <strong>pray spontaneously </strong>using their own choice of words to express their pryers.  A strong emphasis of <strong>reading of the bible</strong> particularly among Protestant denominations has led to many Christians including bible reading as part of their morning and evening prayer.</p>
								</div>
								 <h2>Grace at meals</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Purpose of grace at meals </div>                                     
								<div class="text">A prayer before and/or after eating meals is another widely practiced custom among Christians. This prayer at meal times is known as Grace and it usually takes the form of expressing <strong>gratitude to God for the provisions of the necessities of life</strong>.
								<p>On many occasions Grace at meals provides an occasion to pray for a blessing on those who have provided and prepared the food. It is also often an occasion to pray for the needs of those who suffer through the lack of provisions for the necessities of life.
								 </div> 
								<h2>Quiet times</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Timing of quiet time</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Christian denominations urge their members to find time during the <strong>pressures of normal daily routines</strong> to spend a period of time in prayer. This is often referred to as quiet time. Many Christians will find that prayer at the <strong>beginning and/or end of the day</strong> is the best opportunity for such quiet time. However, others find it important to deliberately <strong>set aside a time</strong> during the day to pray. The timing of this is dependent upon other commitments. For example a person who works at home may take time out when the rest of their family have left for the day. A university student may find time between lectures. An office worker during their lunch break etc. 
								</div>
								
								<div class="footnote">Purpose of quiet time</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The form of prayer used during quiet times will vary greatly.  However, common elements may include prayer of <strong>praise and thanksgiving, bible reading, quiet reflection and prayers of petition</strong>.  The choice of prayer will often change depending on circumstances.  For example a person with a seriously ill relative or friend is likely to have that need as a major part of their prayer.The type of prayer may also depend on the individual's disposition at the time and also the type of spiriuality they prefer.  For example a peron who follows <strong>Pentecostal and Charismatic spirituality</strong> is likely to be inclined more towards prayer of praise.  Likewise person who feels particularly blessed by God through life's circumstances is also likely to be inclined to pray prayers of praise and thanksgiving.
								</div>
								<h2>Prayers of Intercession and Petition</h2>
								<div class="footnote"></div>                                     
								<div class="text">The biblical tradition of Jesus teaching about prayer includes a strong encouragement for Christians to ask in prayer for their needs and the needs of others (Luke 11:10-13). These "asking" prayers are known as <strong>prayers of intercession and prayers of petition</strong>.  
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Prayers fo intercession and petition take many forms </div>                                     
								<div class="text">Prayers of intercession and petition can include many forms. The Lord's prayer for example includes elements of petition and many forms of formal or traditional prayer include such prayers. There are also many prayers of petition written in <strong>books of prayer</strong>. Some books of prayer are arranged with prayers of petition grouped according to the <strong>type of need</strong>. They may include <strong>prayers for the sick, prayers for guidance, prayers for strength during difficult times etc</strong>. Many people will choose their own words in prayers of petition and intercession. These are known as spontaneous or informal prayers.
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Saints</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In some branches of Christianity, such as Orthodox and Catholic there is a strong belief in the <strong>Communion of Saints</strong>.
								  This belief includes aspects where those who have gone before are able
								  to 


                                  <strong> intercede through Jesus to God</strong> on behalf of the people on earth. Thus in some cases Christians
								  will offer their prayers to a particular saint. The use of saints in
								  prayers of intercession is one of the points of division among Christians
								  stemming from the reforms of Martin Luther at the time of the Reformation.
								  Thus intercession through the communion of saints will be seldom used
								  among Protestant Christians.
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Intercession on behalf of others</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Another form of intercession is when one person offers prayers or intercedes <strong>on behalf of others</strong>. Such intercessions are common throughout all denominations of Christianity and people frequently ask others to pray for them.  
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Exact nature of God's response to prayer is a mystery</div>                                     
								<div class="text">While Christians are assured that <strong>God hears and answers</strong> their prayers, the exact nature of the response of God to these prayers is a matter of some conjecture among theologians. Indeed the way in which God responds to prayers of petition is very much at the heart of the mystery of <strong>God's involvement in human history</strong>. Some Christians believe that the degree or quality of a <strong>person's faith</strong> has bearing on the response, others believe that God's <strong>providence and wisdom</strong> are the most critical elements. 
								<p>Despite the differences in understanding regarding the exact nature of God's response to prayer, Christians nevertheless agree that God hears and answers all prayers.
 								</div>
								<h2>Prayers of Reflection and Meditation</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Methods of reflection and relaxation </div>                                     
								<div class="text">Another type of prayer commonly used is that of <strong>meditation and reflection</strong>. This practice involves finding a time and place free from distraction and c<strong>entering one's thoughts on God</strong>. There are many aids that have been developed and many methods proposed to assist people in meditating and reflecting. Some methods involve a process of <strong>relaxation</strong>, some involve <strong>controlled breathing</strong>, still other <strong>music or other sensory aids</strong>. In some forms of meditation a number of aids are used in conjunction with one another. A large variety of resources have been developed in recent times to assist people in undertaking prayers of meditation and reflection. Some of these resources draw on the wisdom of <strong>Eastern religious traditions</strong> such as Hinduism and Buddhism.  
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Purpose of prayers of reflection and meditation </div>                                     
								<div class="text">The main purpose of prayers of reflection and meditation is to create an <strong>inner stillness</strong> which allows a person to deeply <strong>contemplate the nature of God</strong>. This contemplation may involve the use of a biblical image, an aspect of creation or other aid.
								<p>Another purpose of reflective prayer is to contemplate the <strong>meaning of events and circumstance</strong>s of life. In this context the person praying will meditate on certain aspects of life in order to more clearly see and <strong>understand their meaning</strong> in the light of God's love.
								</div>
								<h2>Bible Reading and Reflection</h2>
								<div class="footnote"></div>                                     
								<div class="text">Many of the types of prayer practiced by Christians draw heavily on <strong>biblical texts</strong>. In addition to these biblically based forms of prayer there is also a strong emphasis in most Christian denominations on the reflective <strong>reading of the bible as a form of prayer</strong>.
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Strong tradition of Bible reading in Protestant denominations</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The strongest traditions of bible reading are found among the Protestant denominations of Christianity. These denominations, drawing on Martin Luther's doctrine of "<strong>sola scriptura</strong>" meaning scripture alone, have a strong tradition of <strong>reading scripture</strong>. In more recent times this tradition has influenced other Christian denominations so that bible reading and reflection is now a widely used element of prayer across the spectrum of Christian denominations.
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Purpose of Bible reading and reflection </div>                                     
								<div class="text">When using the bible as an aid to prayer Christians seek to find <strong>inspiration and guidance</strong> through the words of scripture. Thus they may use the text by reflecting on or repeating a short phrase from the text. They may also choose a passage which describes an event from the life of Jesus or in the community of the early Church. In this way they pray seeking to gain <strong>greater insight</strong> into the meaning of the passage and <strong>deepen their understanding </strong>of the Christian way of life.
								</div>
								<h2>Prayers of Praise and Thanksgiving</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Prayers of praise and thanksgiving take many forms</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Praise and thanksgiving are important elements of Christian prayer. They find expression in many forms. <strong>Praying the Psalms</strong> is one of the most widely practiced and traditional forms of praise. It has already been noted that <strong>the Lord's prayer</strong> also contains elements of praise. 
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Pentecostal and Charismatic movements emphasise praise of prayer </div>                                     
								<div class="text">In recent times the growth in the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements has brought a renewed emphasis to the <strong>place of praise in Christian prayer</strong>. In these movements praise is an integral element of prayer and is seen as a way into a <strong>prayerful state</strong>. Most gatherings of Pentecostal and Charismatic Christians would include a <strong>sustained period of praise and thanksgiving</strong>, usually at the beginning of the gathering. Personal prayer for Pentecostal and Charismatic Christians would also normally involve a strong emphasis on praise.  
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Purpose of prayers of praise and thanksgiving </div>                                     
								<div class="text">The purpose of praise in Christian prayer is to allow the person the opportunity to <strong>acknowledge the person of God</strong>. This acknowledgement includes an expression of the <strong>greatness of God</strong> which takes the form of praise. Thanksgiving prayer which is often closely related to prayers of praise has the function of <strong>acknowledging God's actions</strong> in human history and in particular in <strong>providing for the needs of the person</strong> offering the prayer. 
								</div>
								<h2>Schools of Prayer and Spirituality</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Schools of prayer widely used by many Christians</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Throughout Christian history various notable individuals have developed <strong>approaches to prayer</strong> which have been adopted by others. These approaches represent <strong>classical wisdom</strong> in their approaches to prayer. They have existed in the Christian tradition for centuries and are still widely used today. Other approaches are more modern and reflect the issues and concerns of individuals of contemporary Christians.

								<p>Such approaches to prayer are referred to as <strong>schools of prayer </strong>because they represent an approach adopted by significant number of Christians. They also usually provide a more substantial approach than simply a style of prayer. Thus they are recognised as a <strong>form of spirituality</strong> which people can adopt to assist them in their spiritual journey.
								<p> few examples of schools of prayer and spirituality are introduced briefly below.
								</div>
								<h2>Ignatian Spirituality</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Origins</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Based on the inspiration of Spanish soldier and priest <strong>Ignatius of Loyola</strong> (1491-1556). Ignatian spirituality is based on the <strong>Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius</strong> which provide a program of meditations, prayers, considerations and contemplative practices. 
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Use</div>                                     
								<div class="text">They are often used by individuals in a retreat environment because of their <strong>30 day program structure</strong>. Many however, use the spiritual exercises in an ongoing way, adapting the idea of the 30 days to address the various <strong>stages and movements in daily life</strong>.
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Purpose</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The spiritual exercises of Ignatius Loyola are designed to allow <strong>personal journeys and life experiences</strong> of individuals to be brought into relationship with God in a <strong>spiritual connection</strong>.  
								</div>
								<h2>Teresian Spirituality</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Origins</div>                                     
								<div class="text"><strong>Teresa of Avila</strong> (1515-1582) is one of the most famous leaders in the <strong>Christian mystical tradition</strong>. Her own spiritual experiences are documented in her most well known work "<strong>Way of Perfection</strong>".
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Purpose</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Teresian spirituality seeks to follow the example of Teresa of Avila in her own <strong>spiritual journe</strong>y seeking to emulate the experiences of Teresa and in particular her own profound <strong>meditations on the passion of Christ</strong>.
								</div>
								<h2>Taize Prayer</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Origins</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Taize is a small village in France which is home to
								  a well known <strong>ecumenical community 


</strong>                                  founded by <strong>Br
Roger Shutz</strong> and led by him until his death in 2005.
								  The community arose from Br Roger's concern
								  for the pervading sense of disillusion in post
								  World War II Europe. The community that developed
at Taize was to be one of <strong>hope
								  and renewal</strong>. The ecumenical dimension was an important element
								  highlighting the urgent need for unity.
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Use</div>                                     
								<div class="text">From the Taize community a <strong>simple, meditative prayer form</strong> has emerged which is now known as <strong>Taize prayer</strong>. It involves a process of contemplation based on the chanting <strong>recitation of simple mantras</strong>. Taize prayers also include a strong focus on <strong>justice, peace and ecology</strong>.
								</div>
								<h2>Creation Spirituallity</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Origins</div>                                     
								<div class="text">With the increased emphasis on <strong>environmental</strong> concerns there has also been a significant development in the fields of <strong>theology and spirituality</strong>.
								  Through the work of writers and lecturers such as Thomas Berry a spirituality
								  has emerged which is loosely described as Creation Spirituality.

								<p>While Creation Spirituality is generally thought of as a modern movement it is certainly not entirely new. Famous medieval mystic <strong>Hildegard of Bingen</strong> was very evidently a forerunner of the modern movement of Creation Spirituality.
  
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Purpose</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Creation Spirituality celebrates the <strong>spiritual dimension</strong> of creation as the expression of God's love and seeks to highlight the goodness of <strong>creation as a gift of God</strong>. Given the concerns for the environment that are felt by many Christians today, Creation Spirituality provides a helpful vehicle for many to relate to this in a spiritual sense.
