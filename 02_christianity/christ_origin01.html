								<div class="footnote">Judaism in the 1st century</div>                                     
								<div class="text">It is important to begin by examining Judaism in the first century since it was in the first century CE that Christianity branched off from its 
									parent religion Judaism. The power and organisation of Judaism was largely centred in Jerusalem. The authority of Judaism was divided amongst a number 
									of groups who sought to control the direction of the religion. This lack of unity was, in part, the result of centuries of political domination by the 
									Greeks and then the Romans in Palestine and particularly in Jerusalem. Traces of this sectarian rivalry can be detected in the Gospels. The most influential 
									group during the time of Jesus were the <b>Sadducees</b> who had majority representation on the Sanhedrin (Jewish Council). Two other prominent groups were the <b>Zealots</b>, 
									a group of political activists seeking to overthrow the Romans through military methods, and the <b>Pharisees</b> who were devout lay people seeking a more pure expression 
									of Judaism. The influence of the latter sect grew after the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in 70 CE. It was this powerful and prominent influence o f the Pharisees which is reflected in the Gospels.</div>

									<div class="footnote">Messianic expectation</div>                                     
									<div class="text">For centuries Jews expected God to intervene in their
									  history by sending the Messiah to Earth. This belief, a cental tenet
									  of Judaism, is referred to as the <b>Messianic expectation</b>.  This
									  expectation was particalarly heightened during the time of Jesus partly
									  because Jews suffered economic deprivation and great hardships under
									  Roman rule. Consequently, Jews of the first century eagerly awaited
									  the coming of the Messiah who would free them from oppression. However,
									  speculation on the exact nature of the Messiah varied. Many believed
									  that the Messiah would be a political figure in the tradition of King
									  David who would overthrow the Roman rulers and liberate the oppressed
									  Jews. Jesus was born a Jew in this context and lived in Palestine
									  at the beginning of the first century. He sought to renew the Jewish
									  religion in the spirit of the prophets of Israel but did not intend
									  to lead a breakaway from Judaism. It is in witnessing these efforts
									  that his followers come to believe that he was the Messiah.
