									<h1>Content Description</h1>
									<p>The following areas are identified as principal beliefs of Christianity</p>
									<ul>
									<li>The divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ </li>
									<li>The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ</li>
									<li>The nature of God and the Trinity </li>
									<li>Revelation</li>
									<li>Salvation</li>
									</ul>
									<p>For each of these principal beliefs three extracts from the New Testament will be examined.</p> 
									
									<h2>The divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ </h2>
									
									<h3>Matthew 16:13-20</h3>
									<p>This extract from Matthew refers to an event which is also recorded in the other synoptic gospels. It occurs at a time when Jesus is beginning or about to begin his journey to Jerusalem where ultimately he will be arrested and executed. 
									<p>Jesus asks the disciples what the people are saying about him. More exactly he asks "who do people say that the son of man is" (Mt16-13).  Various responses are forthcoming before Jesus asks a second question. "Who do you say that I am" (Mt 16:15). Peter gives the answer "You are the messiah.the son of the living God".  Peter's response is affirmed by Jesus who claims that such an insight has been revealed to him by the Father.
									<p>The extract very clearly affirms the belief of the Mattheaen community that not only was Jesus the chosen one of Israel - the Messiah, he was also the Son of God. To claim sonship was tantamount to claiming equality with God. Thus the extract demonstrates the belief in the divinity of Jesus. While making no explicit reference to the humanity of Jesus it nonetheless affirms this reality with the human Jesus of Nazareth being heralded as Son of God.</p>
									<h3>John 1:1-14</h3>
									<p>The beginning of the gospel of John speaks poetically about the origins of creation and how Jesus, the word, was with God in all eternity (Jn 1:1-3).                                                           
									<p>The passage uses the imagery of the light breaking into the darkness to allude to the great act of salvation in Jesus. It then speaks of the role of John the Baptist as the forerunner to Jesus before returning to focus on the role of Jesus as the word. 
									<p>In verse 14 it describes how Jesus, the eternal word of God, came to dwell among us and be one with us. Literally the text says "he pitched his tent among us".  This is a powerful image highlighting the full humanity of Jesus.
									<h3>Hebrews 4:14-16</h3>
									<p>This extract from the letter to the Hebrew begins with a statement affirming the divinity of Jesus "we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens" (Heb 4:14). It then goes on to explain that in Jesus the high priest there is also the dimension of him having experienced all that is associated with human existence (Heb 4:15).  
									<p>In other words, Jesus is fully human and thus able to understand the exact nature of the human condition. Yet, he is also fully divine and thus able to intercede for human kind.  He has both the power to save and the compassion to empathise with human need.
									</p>
									
									<h2>The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ</h2>
									<h3>Luke 9: 22</h3>
									<p>This extract from the gospel of Luke comes immediately after Peter's declaration of faith in Jesus as the messiah. It is one of three passion predictions which are found in the synoptic gospels. These passion predictions have Jesus announcing the circumstances of his coming death as he journeys towards Jerusalem.
									<p>The significance of this passage is that is shows that Jesus' death and resurrection were a necessary part of his mission. In other words these predictions, placed in the mouth of Jesus by the synoptic writers, identify the inevitability of his death and at the same time the certainty of his resurrection.
									<p>Thus the communities writing the gospel affirm their faith in Jesus dying on the cross and then being raised on the third day as a central and indispensable part of their gospel message.
									</p>
									<h3>1 Corinthians 15:12-19</h3>
									<p>This extract from Paul's first letter to the Church at Corinth is the first part of a long discussion on the matter of the resurrection. It is important to note that many of Paul's teachings come in response to questions from the community of in order to challenge beliefs and practices that have arisen which are contrary to the gospel. 
									<p>In this situation Paul seems to be challenging an idea among the Corinthians that there will be no resurrection of the dead. Paul affirms in the strongest possible terms that the resurrection is an integral part of Christian belief. Paul argues that "if Christ was not raised, your faith is worthless (1Cor15:16)
									</p>
									<h3>1 Corinthians 15:35-44</h3>
									<p>The second part of Paul's discussion on the resurrection deals with the manner of the resurrection. Once again it is clear that he is responding to matters that have arisen in the Church at Corinth. Paul uses the analogy of a seed dying and a plant sprouting to affirm that resurrection is a transformation of the body and not merely a resuscitation of the body.
									<p>He finishes his discussion by affirming the eternal or incorruptible nature of the resurrected body in contrast to the mortal human body which is subject to decay. He also affirms the strength, glory and spiritual character of the resurrected body (1 Cor 15:42-44)
									</p>
									
									<h2>The nature of God and the Trinity</h2>
									
									<h3>Luke 3:21-22</h3>
									<p>This passage from Luke's gospel is an account of Jesus being baptised by John. It is an event which is found in each of the synoptic gospels and perhaps alluded to in a passage from John's gospel (Jn 1:31-34).
									<p>The passage is significant because through the mind of the author it provides a glimpse into the three persons of the trinity. Jesus has been baptised and while he is at prayer the Spirit descends on him in the form of a dove. At the same time the voice of the Father is heard declaring that his favour rests on Jesus his son (Lk 3:22).
									<p>Thus is Luke's simple description there is testimony to the three persons of the trinity in relationship at the time of the baptism of Jesus.
									</p>
									<h3>John 16:5-16</h3>
									<p>This passage from John forms part of the long prayer prayed by Jesus on the night before his death. This particular part of the prayer focuses on Jesus' departure and the subsequent coming of the Spirit.
									<p>The passage includes reference to the Father and Spirit in the prayer of Jesus once again affirming the belief in the trinity held by the writer through the description of the three persons of the trinity in relationship.
									</p>
									<h3>1 John 5:1-12</h3>
									<p>The extract from the first letter of John is another example reflecting the faith of the early Church in the trinity of Father, Son and Spirit.
									<p>The first verse in this section identifies a relationship between Jesus and the Father (1Jn 5:1). The same verse highlights the closeness of the relationship between the believer and these two persons of the trinity speaking of faith in Jesus and love of the Father.
									<p>Later in verse 6 the writer speaks of the role of the Holy Spirit in giving testimony to Jesus and affirming the truth of this testimony.
									<p>Finally in verses 11 and 12 the writer again speaks of the testimony of the Spirit and refers to the relationship between Jesus and the Father thus affirming the tradition of belief in the trinity.
									</p>
									
									<h2>Revelation</h2>
									
									<h3>John 20:30-31</h3>
									<p>This extract from the gospel of John deals with the purpose of scripture. Scripture is recognised as a key vehicle of revelation.
									<p>In this extract the writer indicates that the reason the gospel account has been prepared is to provide an incentive to believe in Jesus. In other words it identifies the rhetorical character of the text. It is not written to provide documentary evidence or biographical detail. It is written in order that the hearer or reader may be convinced and thus led to faith. With this in mind it is possible to understand the historical character as incidental to the main purpose.
									<p>The gospel can be therefore understood as a document of faith. It is a reflection of the faith of the early Church community and an invitation for the audience to embrace the same faith.
									</p>
									<h3>2 Timothy 3:15-16</h3>
									<p>This extract from the second letter of Paul to Timothy contains a number of statements which are at the heart of the Christian understanding of revelation.
									<p>Firstly it speaks of Timothy's life long knowledge of the sacred scriptures and affirms these as "the source of wisdom which through faith in Jesus Christ leads to salvation" (2 Tim 3:15). This verse also affirms the purpose of this "wisdom" as leading to salvation.
									<p>The following verse reflects the Christian belief that scripture is inspired by God and also highlights its usefulness for teaching and also for correcting errors in the community.
									</p>
									<h3>2 Peter 1:20-21</h3>
									<p>This passage from the second letter of Peter addresses the theme of prophecy and individual interpretation. It also takes up the theme of the inspiration of scripture.
									<p>The passage begins by denying that there is any element of personal interpretation found in the prophecy of scripture. This is followed by an affirmation that it is the inspiration of the Spirit which is the source of prophecy. The aspect of the inspiration of the Spirit is identified here as acting under the influence of God.
									<p>This passage affirms therefore that the scriptures contain that which God wishes to be passed on. This affirmation is tempered by the notion that scripture is written for the purpose of encouraging faith, not to provide historical, scientific or other perspectives.
									</p>
									
									<h2>Salvation</h2>
									
									<h3>Matthew 25:26-31</h3>
									<p>This passage presents a scene from the last judgement when all people are to be called before God to give account of their lives. In this depiction people are separated into two groups. One of these groups is to be blessed with the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven. The second group is those to be condemned to "the everlasting fire" (Mt 21:41).
									<p>In this judgement scene the factor which distinguishes the blessed from the condemned is their treatment of others and in particular the treatment of the most vulnerable in the community. These vulnerable ones are referred to as "the least of these brethren of mine" (Mt 25:40).
									<p>The implication of this passage is that eternal salvation is integrally connected to the treatment of others especially those who have the greatest need.
									</p>
									<h3>John 3:16-17</h3>
									<p>Perhaps the best known of all scripture texts is verse 16 of this passage from John. "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son that whoever believes in him may not die but may have eternal life." (Jn 3:16). This verse conveys the relationship between the sending of Jesus by the Father and the gift of salvation. 
									<p>This idea is further explained in verse 17 "that the world may be saved through him" which illustrates the fundamental Christian belief that salvation comes through Jesus.
									</p>
									<h3>Romans 5: 1-11</h3>
									<p>In his letter to the Romans, Paul goes to considerable length to explain his thesis about the way Jesus has brought salvation to humankind. One example of this explanation is his discussion of faith, hope and love in this famous section of the letter.
																			 <p>He begins by affirming the belief that it is through faith in Jesus Christ that we find peace with God (Rom 5:1). He goes on to explain that the event of Christ's death highlights the degree of God's love for humankind (Rom 5:8).
																			 <p>This love is at the heart of God's saving action and the assurance of this salvation brought by the love of God provides humankind with hope to experience eternal life with God (Rom 5:2).
