									<h1>Specimen Questions </h1>
									<p><strong>Outline the main ethical teachings of Christianity and assess their role in guiding the lives of adherents.</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Analyse the relationship among the principal elements of ethical teaching in Christianity.</strong></p>
										 
								<h2>Sample Responses</h2>
											<p><strong>Outline the main ethical teachings of Christianity and assess their role in guiding the lives of adherents</strong></p>
											<p>The main ethical teachings of Christianity can be found in the Golden Rule, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" (Matthew 7:12 and Luke 6:31), the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-7 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21) and the Beatitudes. The voluminous mass of Christian ethics can be distilled into the covenantal requirement to love God, and to love your neighbour, which is expressed in terms of a new commandment in the Gospel of John. In essence, this requirement of love can be further simplified as the Golden Rule. 
											<p>These main ethical teachings are of critical importance in guiding the response of adherents to ethical dilemmas by offering a general model for Christian life  that is founded on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. These general ethical principles arose out of the context of Jesus' advocacy for the vulnerable and core values from his ministry such as love and forgiveness. There is little difference in the understanding of these fundamental ethical teachings across the spectrum of Christian denominations. Differences arise, however, regarding the specific application of these general principles because of the different emphasis placed on the teaching authority of the Church in illuminating the specific meaning of these ethical principles. 
											<p>All followers of the Christian religion can be expected to place considerable value on the ethical teachings of Christianity in guiding them to make informed moral choices. The application of the key ethical principles varies across the denominations in terms of what sort of specific ethical guidance it provides. Catholic and Orthodox denominations place a greater emphasis on the guidance of Church authorities in the area of ethics. This is because they believe that the revelation of God comes through scripture in the light of tradition. In other words, tradition illuminates the meaning of scripture. In contrast Protestant denominations place greater emphasis on the central role of the bible in providing ethical guidance. Even within Protestant denominations however, there are subtle variations regarding the way in which scripture guides the lives of the adherents. High Church Anglicans have an approach that is similar to the Catholic and Orthodox denominations in their belief that scripture a												nd tradition go hand in hand. In contrast the Low Church Anglicans take a more fundamentalist approach to the Bible. 
											<p>Despite these differences of application, there are very few identifiable differences across the Christian spectrum regarding the understanding of the primary ethical teachings that guide adherents. The general direction of life for adherents is contained in the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount. The Ten Commandments offer a succinct summary of Christian ethics stressing the importance of human life and the need to respect family and personal integrity. The commandments also known as the Decalogue provide the backdrop for an understanding of New Testament ethics. 
											<p>In the New Testament the Beatitudes is a critical passage that underpins the Christian ethical system. The Beatitudes, which are found in the context of the Sermon on the Mount, provide a model for Christian life by describing a life of advocacy for the poor and vulnerable and thus stressing the values of kindness, mercy, compassion and justice. The emphasis in the Beatitudes on an ethical stance which stands in contrast to the dominant culture, that values material strength and power, mirrors the counter-cultural nature of Christian ethics. For example, Jesus teaches us that the wealth of Christian ethical laws can be distilled into two primary categories, love of God and love of neighbour. Love therefore, as Paul notes in Letters to the Corinthians is the requirement that fulfils the law as it is the element which gives meaning to all other virtues. 
											<p>This requirement of love is taken to a new level in the ministry of Jesus where the commandment to love your neighbour is extended to love for enemies. This can be seen in Luke 6:27 which urges us to "Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you". The importance of this core requirement of love is evident in that the requirement is conveyed in terms of a new commandment in the Gospel of John. Here, love of neighbour as God has loved us is seen as the identifying characteristic of the Christian life. This requirement of love can be summed up as "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" (Matthew 7:12 and Luke 6:31). This concept, also known as the Golden Rule provides a broad principle that guides the lives of the adherents. 
											<p>What is evident is that the main ethical teachings of Christianity are based on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Accordingly then, another primary source of ethical guidance for Christians is the life of Jesus. Jesus is the embodiment of the primary Christian virtues mentioned above. These virtues flowed into his life of advocacy for the weak and vulnerable members of society. Therefore, it is safe to say that the general Christian ethos of caring for those in need is directly attributable to the example of Jesus.     
											<p>The main ethical principles of Christianity readily flow into specific teachings and guidance on current ethical issues. Traditionally, many believe that Christianity only offers ethical advice on a narrow range of issues, usually associated with sexual morality and bio-ethics. This sort of teaching has been in line with more conservative forces in society. Other areas of teaching, however, teaching on issues of economic, ecological and military significance are more in line with the progressive elements in society. Considering the enormous diversity of issues traversed by Christian ethics it is difficult to accurately assess the overall effect of Christian ethical teachings.   
											<p>In conclusion it is evident that there are significant similarities regarding the interpretation of the main ethical teachings, relating to the love of God and neighbour, love as the identifying characteristic of the Christian life and the Golden rule, a role reversal principal. This is because all Christian denominations base their ethical guidance on biblical teachings, and especially the New Testament which contains the four Gospels. 
											<p>Accordingly, Christian adherents are guided in terms of broad ethical principles. When it comes to the specific application of these overall principles, however, there is an enormous diversity regarding the acceptance of ethical teaching on specific contemporary issues. On top of this, the different views regarding the acceptance of Church teachings on ethical principles means that there is an even greater diversity on how the general ethical principles are applied to specific situations Nevertheless, it is clear that Christian ethics do play a significant role in helping adherents make informed moral choices according to the principles of the tradition.  
											<h3>Outline and explain the principal ethical teachings contained in the Ten Commandments and the New Testament (scaffold)</h3>
											<h3>Introduction (193 words)</h3>
											<p>The chief source of ethical guidance for Christians is the New Testament and the Gospels. The Old Testament, which contains the Ten Commandments, forms the background upon which Christians come to understand the ethical requirements of the New Testament. While the Ten Commandments underpin the principal beliefs in Christian ethics, the New Testament offers a further distillation of the ethical laws contained in the Old Testament into love of God and love of neighbour. 
											<p>Furthermore, the New Testament takes the underlying covenantal requirement of love to a new level where firstly, Christians are required to love one's enemy and secondly, because of this, love becomes the identifying characteristic of Christian life. The Beatitudes are a widely used source of ethical guidance for Christians and the Golden Rule is said to sum up Christian ethics. 
											<p>There is little recognisable difference amongst the Christian denominations regarding the importance of the main ethical principles. However, there are some differences of application when broad principles are employed to specific issues due to the differing opinion between the Protestant and Catholic Churches regarding the emphasis that should be given to the teaching authority of the Church. 
											<h3>Section 1 (150 words)</h3> 
											<p>Give a brief summary of the contents of the Ten Commandments and state that the Decalogue is held in common by Jews and Christians alike. Explain the importance of these commandments in the context of Christian ethics. Explain the relationship between the nature of the commandments as a succinct summary of Christian ethics and the way it is used to structure Christian ethics in general. Evaluate the importance of the Ten Commandments by stating that they were not used regularly by early Christians, but were used more frequently in later Church history. 
											<h3>Section 2 (100 words)</h3> 
											<p>Emphasise the fact that the fundamental source of ethical guidance for Christians is the New Testament because it contains the Gospels. Provide a succinct summary of the key ethical statements contained in the New Testament, such as the Golden Rule and the requirement to love your neighbour and to love God. Link this to a brief statement about the role of the Bible as providing a model for life action.  
											<h3>Section 3 (150 words)</h3> 
											<p>Evaluate the importance of the Beatitudes by emphasising its role as a foundational passage in Christian ethics. Locate the Beatitudes, as being the definitive passage within the Sermon on the Mount. Give a brief summary of the contents of the Beatitudes and link this to the role of New Testament ethics as setting out a template for Christian life. State that the Sermon on the Mount also contains the Golden rule and cite the passage in the Bible for this principle. Evaluate the importance of the Golden rule by stating that it is considered to be the summation of Christian ethics. 
											<h3>Section 4 (150 words)</h3> 
											<p>Explain Jesus' commandment of love as the distillation of Christian ethics into love of God and love of neighbour. Provide a brief explanation of what these terms mean by citing relevant passages from the Bible. Link this to the question by demonstrating how these principles relate to the application of Christian ethics for believers. 
											<h3>Section 5 (200 words)</h3> 
											<p>Discuss how this requirement to love is conveyed in terms of a new commandment in John's Gospel. Evaluate the importance of this requirement as the identifying characteristic of Christian life and cite relevant Biblical passages to demonstrate this point. Provide further explanation regarding the importance of this requirement of love, by showing that love is considered to be the essential quality which gives meaning and life to all other virtues. Cite relevant Biblical passages to strengthen this point. 
											<h3>Section 6 (150 words)</h3> 
											<p>Evaluate the importance of these principal ethical teachings in relation to their application by the different Christian denominations. Emphasise the fact that there are no identifiable differences among the different denominations concerning their understanding of these principles, rather these differences relate to the application of this knowledge to specific situations. State that Protestant denominations make more direct use of Biblical authority, whereas the Catholic and Orthodox Churches place a greater emphasis on the teaching authority of the Church. Briefly explain the reasons for the Protestant stance on Biblical authority by relating it to the causes of the Protestant Reformation.    
											<h3>Conclusion (184 words)</h3> 
											<p>In conclusion, it can be seen that the major source of ethical guidance for Christians are the Ten Commandments and the New Testament, which contains the distillation of Christian ethics into the love of God and neighbour and the Golden Rule. This requirement to love is taken to a new level because love is seen as the identifying characteristic of Christian life. The Ten Commandments provide a backdrop to understanding the ethical teachings contained in the New Testament. The ethical requirements contained in the New Testament are an attempt to move away from a legalistic application of the law in its emphasis on the underlying principles of love, mercy, compassion, justice and peace. Another distinct characteristic of Christian ethics is its emphasis on love of neighbour and love of enemy. Whilst there are some recognisable differences amongst the different denominations regarding the specific application of the ethical principles these differences are not overly significant. It is clear that											 the principal ethical teachings are of great importance to all Christian denominations and that there are very few identifiable differences in their understanding of these concepts.
