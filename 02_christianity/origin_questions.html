									<h1>Specimen Questions</h1>
							  			<p><strong>Evaluate the role of Jesus and Paul in the founding and development of early Christianity (20 marks)</strong></p> 
											<p><strong>Outline the origins and describe the main characteristics of two significant groups within the Christian tradition (20 marks)</strong></p> 
											<h2>Sample Responses</h2>
											<p><strong>Evaluate the role of Jesus and Paul in the founding and development of early Christianity (20 marks)</strong></p> 
											<p>Jesus, who is typically known as the founder of Christianity and Paul, who is considered as the second founder of Christianity, were instrumental in the development of early Christianity. Where Jesus set down the foundational message of Christianity concerning the reign of God Paul helped to set up the structure of this new religion and transformed the status of Christianity vis-à-vis Judaism. There is no evidence to suggest that Jesus wanted to found a new religion. In fact Jesus' opposition to the legalism Judaism exhibited at the time was an attempt to renew Judaism in terms of the prophets. On the other hand, Paul integrated Hellenistic philosophy with the Jewish message of Jesus to develop a Christian identity which was increasingly distinct and separate from Judaism.</p>  
											
											<p>Jesus is typically hailed as the founder of Christianity yet there is no indication that he intended to found a new religion. Rather Jesus was born a Jew, lived as a Jew and died a Jew. Jesus' greatest contribution to Christianity was the central focus of his teachings concerning the reign of God. Essentially, the reign of God is a state where justice, love, peace etc is lived. The reign of God was inaugurated through the ministry of Jesus and this reign will be fulfilled at the end of time. Until then, it is the responsibility of the followers of Jesus to live in accordance with these values and to lead others to them as well. Thus, the reign of God is considered as a present yet future reality. Jesus sought to renew Judaism from within by emphasising the broad principles of mercy, love, peace and justice as a challenge to the legalistic nature of Judaism during that time. Since he did not intend to found a new religion it is not surprising therefore to find that he left very few instructions												. He only left instructions to preach, baptise, heal the sick, feed the poor and forgive and these instructions are surprisingly direct and simple.</p>  
											<p>In order to appreciate the contribution of Jesus to Christianity we need to understand the influence of the concept of Jesus of History and Christ of Faith. This is a term used by scholars to differentiate historical aspects of story of Jesus from those that belong in the realm of faith. Historically, Jesus was a man who was from Nazareth in Galilee. He travelled to Jerusalem with a reputation as a miracle worker and after coming into conflict with the political leaders of the time he was executed. The search for the historical Jesus has been a major focus of biblical scholarship. It includes the process of examining the similarities and differences between the synoptic gospels, that is, Matthew, Mark and Luke. Scholars have tried to explain the relationship between the Gospels which are quite similar yet unique. This area of study is known as the Synoptic problem. The most important lesson that can be drawn from the synoptic problem is that whilst the Gospels provide an historical framework f												or the life and ministry of Jesus they do not set out to provide an exact historical record. We need to remember that the Gospels were written for a specific audience and that rhetoric rather than historical accuracy is the dominant concern of the writer. Consequently when we consider the importance of Jesus to the development of Christianity we should not merge the different Gospel stories together to form a composite picture of Jesus as each Gospel stands alone.</p>   
											<p>Another stage in the search for a historical Jesus was the use of rhetorical criticism which is a scientific study of the reasons behind why the Gospels were written and how they were edited. Through rhetorical criticism, scholars have been able to provide some understanding about intention of the gospel writers and the message they were seeking to convey. Similarly, we learn that the Gospels were written so that the early Church could pass on their faith rather than as an historical or scientific account of the life of Jesus. 
											<p>Whilst the search for a historical Jesus is important if we are to assess the contribution of Jesus to Christianity there is a need to balance this search with an understanding of the Christ of Faith concept. It is the statements of faith, regarding his death, resurrection and ascension which have had the greatest impact on the development of early Christianity. This influence is twofold: firstly, it laid the foundation for doctrinal teachings such as the belief that Christ died for our sins and that life after death can overcome the limitations of human mortality. The difficulty of explaining Jesus' resurrection without depicting it as a bodily resuscitation led to the Christological debates regarding the humanity and divinity of Jesus which raged in the fourth and fifth centuries. Secondly, the eschatological nature of Jesus' ministry meant that he left no instructions for an institutional Church. His followers believed that they were living in the last days before the Parousia which refers 												to the second coming of Christ. Thus they did not see the need to institute a formal structure for the religion and consequently there was a considerable variety in the nature of the early Church.</p>  
											<p>After the death of Jesus, groups of Diaspora Hellenistic Jews and Gentiles followed Jesus through the teachings of Paul. Paul's major contribution to Christianity was that because he employed Hellenistic philosophy to translate Jesus' Jewish message and in doing so assisted to set up the structure of this new religion. The introduction of Hellenistic philosophy resulted in the formation of the theology of salvation, justification and law which was not in Jesus' original teachings. These new concepts utilised Hellenistic philosophy that was deeply ingrained within the culture of the time. This helped to transform the status of Christianity vis-à-vis Judaism. Jesus unlike Paul made no attempt to establish a new religion. Jesus saw his contribution as one which revived the Jewish tradition in terms of the prophets.</p>  
											<p>While the earliest followers of Jesus believed that they were a following a sect within Judaism, Paul's efforts meant that Christianity was becoming an increasing distinct and separate religion from Judaism. Paul played a key role in some of the more decisive debates in early Christianity. The original Jewish nature of Christianity was soon challenged by the conversion of the Gentiles who gradually came to outnumber the Jewish Christians of Palestinian descent. Peter who led the group of Palestinian Christians argued that Gentiles had to become Jews in order to become Christian. Paul argued otherwise in claiming that the conversion of Gentiles to Judaism was not necessary. This debate led to the formation of the Council of Jerusalem in 49 CE which represents an early attempt to centralise differences within the diverse Church community. Despite the apparent resolution of this issue this topic continued to be the source of some uneasiness in the early Christian community. After 70 CE Paul's gro												up of Jewish Christians of Diaspora Hellenistic background merged with the Gentile Christians, and continued to grow whilst the Palestinian group continued to break up and decrease in size. During this time Christian beliefs were becoming increasingly centralised as the institutionalisation of the charism was necessary due to the delay of the Parousia. The death of Paul meant that there was an even greater need to institutionalise the charism and provide a framework for the growth of Christianity.</p>  
											<p>In conclusion, it can be seen that two key figures of Christianity, Jesus and
Paul were highly influential in the founding and development of early Christianity.

Where Jesus' greatest contribution was his eschatological message
											  regarding the reign of God, Paul
  assisted to translate this concept and make it accessible to the wider world
  by utilising Hellenistic philosophy. Paul translated the Jewish message into
  one that could be understood outside Palestinian confines. It is clear that
  where Jesus set out to reform the legalistic nature of Judaism, Paul gradually
											  transformed the status of Christianity
  as a religion distinct and separate from Judaism. Both Jesus and Paul were
  nevertheless instrumental in the founding and development of Christianity.</p>
