									<h1>Specimen Questions </h1>
									<p><strong>Outline and assess the influence of different schools of thought in the development of Christian beliefs about the trinity. (20 marks)</strong></p> 
											<p><strong>Analyse the way in which Christian beliefs relating to the humanity and divinity of Jesus were confirmed. (20 marks)</strong></p> 
											<h2>Sample Responses</h2>
											<p><strong>Analyse the way in which Christian beliefs relating to the humanity and divinity of Jesus were confirmed </strong></p> 
										 	<p>The principal Christian beliefs relating to the humanity and the divinity of Jesus were confirmed and refined through a series of debates, known as the Christological controversies, which took place in the fourth and fifth centuries. The issue at the heart of the debate was whether Jesus could be fully human and as well fully God, that is fully divine. 
											<p>These debates saw the introduction of numerous influential heresies such as Docetism and Arianism which led to the formation of ecumenical councils that responded to these heresies by further defining and refining the principal Christian beliefs relating to the humanity and divinity of Jesus. The councils concluded that overemphasising the divinity or humanity of Jesus leads to a distorted picture of Jesus Christ. 
											<p>One influential heresy is a position known as Docetism, which claims that Jesus was fully divine but not truly human. Another influential heresy was Arianism, which is the belief that Jesus was not fully divine. Finally, in the fifth century a position put forward by Nestorius claimed that there were two separate persons within Jesus, a divine person and a human person. 
											<p>One of the key tenets of the belief relating to the humanity and divinity of Jesus is the idea that Jesus is truly and fully human and yet he is fully divine and hence fully God. This view was clarified and confirmed in response to the Docetist view which claimed that Jesus was not truly human rather he was God who assumed the appearance of being human. In other words, he was fully divine but was not fully human because he was God with the appearance of being human. 
											<p>This doctrine clearly undermined the integrity of the humanity of Jesus and accordingly was rejected by Orthodox Christians. The response to Docetism clearly confirmed the view that Jesus is fully human and yet fully God. 
											Arianism was an influential heresy which questioned whether it was possible for Jesus to be both fully and completely divine and yet truly human.  Arius who most influentially espoused this view taught that Jesus is superior to the rest of creation but he is less divine than God. In other words, Jesus is not actually God because he is not fully divine. 
											<p>The implication of this view was that only the Father was God even though his Son could reveal God to humanity. Arianism was a highly influential view which led to a divisive dispute in the early Christian Church. Subsequently, Constantine called for the formation of the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE to resolve this issue. The council concluded that Jesus was of one substance with the Father. Thus, Jesus is fully divine as well as fully human. This decision was later reaffirmed by the Council of Constantinople. As we can see the confirmation of pre-existing views regarding the humanity and the divinity of Jesus came about due to common and prevalent heresies.
											<p>Where Arianism downplayed the divine aspect of Jesus, Nestorius in the fifth century claimed that Jesus was fully divine and fully human. However, Nestorius taught that the divine person was separate and independent from the human person. Essentially, Nestorius claimed that there were two separate persons within Jesus, a divine person and a human person. Nestorius then went on to make the claim that Mary was the mother of the human Jesus but not the divine Jesus. This clearly undermined the integrity of the person of Jesus. 
											The Council of Ephesus in 431 CE was called to respond to this heresy. They confirmed the view that Christ is fully human and fully divine. Thus, Mary is the Mother of God as well as being the mother of the human Jesus. Once again, what is evident is that a heresy prompts the formation of an ecumenical council to clarify and confirm existing contemporary beliefs regarding the divinity and the humanity of Jesus Christ. 
											<p>In conclusion, the principal Christian beliefs relating to the humanity and divinity and Jesus were confirmed through a series of influential heresies, which led to the formation of ecumenical councils. These councils reaffirmed and formalised pre-existing beliefs regarding the humanity and divinity of Jesus. These councils authorised and refined the pre-existing view that Jesus is both fully divine and fully human and that these supposedly contradictory elements exist as a whole in the one person of Jesus. 
											<h3>Outline and assess the influence of different schools of thought in the development of Christian beliefs about the trinity (scaffold)</h3>
											<p><strong>Introduction (190 words)
											</strong>
											<p>The Christian understanding regarding the trinity is the result of the various schools of thought further developing and refining the core belief in the trinity. The Trinity is a central tenet of Christianity which states that there are three separate and distinct persons in the one God. That is God the Father, Jesus the Son and Holy Spirit the sanctifier. These three persons are considered as co-eternal and co-equal meaning that firstly, neither person is of greater importance than the other and secondly, that there was never a time when one person existed and another did not. 
											<p>God's plan of salvation for human kind works through the trinity and thus God is revealed as trinity. This belief was mainly the result of intense discussion and debate during the fourth century at the councils of Nicaea in 325 CE and Constantinople in 381 CE. These councils dealt predominately with Cappadocian theology which has been highly influential in shaping our contemporary understanding of the trinity. Cappadocian theology refined an earlier school of thought which existed during the time of Jesus that demonstrates the basic belief regarding the plurality of God. 
											<p><strong>Section 1 (200 words) 
											</strong>
											<p>Briefly outline the early beliefs regarding the plurality of God, with reference to Jesus calling God "abba" and the baptismal formulae. Explain how this early Christian practice gave rise to the central Christian belief regarding the existence of the trinity, in that there are three co-eternal, equal persons. Weigh up the importance of these early developments by emphasising that these practices provide the basis of the core principles of the trinity. 
											<p><strong>Section 2 (100 words)
											</strong>
											<p>Explain the apparent contradictions relating to the belief in the trinity. That is how questions of the relationship between Jesus and the Father led to the error of ditheism, and similarly how questions of the relationship between Father, Son and Spirit led to the error of tritheism. Elaborate on these theological contradictions, by pointing out the issue of whether unity can also be trinity, and subsequently is God three only in terms of economy or is God three at an intra divine level?
											<p><strong>Section 3 (200 words) 
											</strong>
											<p>Give an explanation of the teachings of Cappadocian theology and show how this school of thought attempts to answer the fundamental and essential question of how it was possible for God to be one yet three. 
											<p>Essentially, they taught that God was of one essence but three persons, and subsequently, the divine essence is common to all three. 
											<p>Evaluate the importance of this school of thought by stressing that Cappadocian theology was highly influential in addressing one aspect of the debate regarding the trinity, more specifically the issue of how unity can also be trinity. 
											<p>Furthermore, emphasise the idea that this school of thought did not invent the possibility of the existence of unity within trinity, rather they further refined the pre-existing notions regarding the trinity.      
											<p><strong>Section 4 (200 words) 
											</strong>
											<p>Evaluate the impact of this school of thought by deconstructing the main components of Cappadocian theology and the implications of their teachings on the theological understanding of the trinity. That is, stress the points of common essence but different roles and the notion of mutual relations and how that relates to the issue of the three persons being co-equal and co-eternal and thus providing an explanation of the notion of unity in community. 
											<p><strong>Section 5 (150 words)
											</strong>
											<p>Briefly state the current belief regarding the inter-relationship between the three persons, and clarify how this issue is different to and a development upon the issue dealt with by Cappadocian theology. Trace the historical development of this school of thought and evaluate its influence by stating that in the development of Trinitarian theology the West tended to focus on the immanent trinity and the East tended to focus on the economic trinity. 
											<p><strong>Conclusion (107 words) 
											</strong>
											<p>In conclusion, it can be seen that the contemporary understanding on the issue of the trinity is the result of significant developments and refinements which took place during the fourth century. Early Christian practices, Cappadocian theology and Western and Eastern theological teachings on the issue of the trinity have affirmed the foundational belief in the idea that there are three co-eternal, equal persons in one God. Despite differences in the Western and Eastern beliefs regarding the exact nature of the trinity, essentially the different schools of thought emphasise the importance of the belief in the trinity by proclaiming that it is a central tenet of Christian belief.
