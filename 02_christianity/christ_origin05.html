										<div class="text">Before considering the distinguishing characteristics of the major groupings within Christianity it will be helpful to briefly survey the contours of history which gave rise to the existence of different groups in the Christian family.
											<p>While there have undoubtedly been differences and divisions among Christians from the very beginning, the first major schism did not occur until over a thousand years after the life and ministry of Jesus.</p>
								  </div> 
								</div>
								
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">East/ West Schism </div>                                     
									<div class="text">This first schism, known as the Great Schism or <strong>East West Schism</strong> was formalised in 1054 CE. This formally divided the Christian Church into two major groups known today as <strong>Catholic</strong> (Western Christianity) and <strong>Orthodox</strong> (Eastern Christianity). The Catholic Church is predominantly Roman Catholic though there are other groups such as Maronite and Melkite which are known as Eastern Rite Catholic. In the Orthodox tradition a number of Churches exist including Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Antiochean (Syrian) Orthodox and Coptic (Egyptian).

								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Reformation</div>                                     
									<div class="text">
									  The next major schism occurred in the 16th century
									  in the Western or Catholic Church. This Western schism is known as the <strong>Reformation</strong> and led to the formation of the <strong>Protestant Churches</strong> which separated
									  from the Roman Catholic Church. The Protestant
									  Churches following the reforms of <strong>Martin Luther</strong> included
									  the Lutherans and Presbyterians. The Church
									  of England (Anglican) also separated from Roman Catholicism at this
									  time though it did so for different reasons. 
									  <p>As time went on the fragmentation of Western
									    Christianity continued with various <strong>reforms and realignments</strong> taking
									    place within the Protestant and Anglican
									    groupings. For example the Baptist and
									    Congregationalist Churches formed from within the Protestant tradition
									    while the Methodist and Salvation Army groups grew from within the
									    Anglican tradition. </p>
									  <p>The most recent fragmentations within Western
									      Christianity have come through the
									    development of <strong>Pentecostal
									      Churches</strong> which have mostly emerged within the last 150
									      years from within Protestant groups. </p>

								<h2>Anglican Church</h2>
									<div class="footnote">Origins</div>                                     
									<div class="text"> The Church of England or Anglican Church stems from
									  the 16th century schism known as the Reformation. During this
								    time the <strong>King of England, Henry VIII</strong>, formalised
								    the separation between the <strong>Church of England</strong> and
								    the Roman Catholic Church.</div>

								<div class="content2">
										<div class="footnote">Head of Church</div>                                     
									<div class="text">Today the Anglican Church is found in many countries throughout the world, principally in those with close historical ties to England. The nominal head of the Anglican Church is the English Monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II. However authority in the Anglican Church is more practically expressed in the leadership of the <strong>Archbishop of Canterbury</strong>, currently Archbishop Rowan Williams.

								<div class="content2">
										<div class="footnote">Principal beliefs and sacraments</div>                                     
									<div class="text">The key elements of the Anglican Church are summed up according to the statements of the <strong>Lambeth conference</strong> in 1920 which stressed the <strong>centrality of the bible</strong> and confirmed that it contained everything necessary for salvation. It also highlighted the Apostles Creed and Nicene Creed and statements which accurately and reliably expressed the Christian faith. Lambeth also confirmed that two sacraments are to be celebrated as part of the Christian faith. These <strong>two sacraments</strong> are Baptism and the Lord's Supper. Finally, Lambeth affirmed the importance of the historical line of succession of Bishops known as the "<strong>historic episcopate</strong>".

								<div class="content2">
										<div class="footnote">Subdivisions withing the Church</div>                                     
									<div class="text">Within the Anglican Church there are two recognizable groups with their own particular emphases. The larger of the two groups is known as <strong>High Church Anglican</strong>, sometimes referred to as Anglo Catholic. The second group is known as <strong>Low Church Anglican</strong>, sometimes referred to as Evangelical Anglican. 
										High Church Anglicans are recognizable through the retention of a number of <strong>Roman Catholic rituals and practices</strong>. These include the use of vestments, incense and their ministers being known as Priests. Low Church Anglicans are more closely aligned with the <strong>Protestant tradition</strong> with Ministers leading congregations and worship carried out with very little adornment.
										While the majority of Anglicans throughout the world belong to the High Church group, it is worth noting that the Anglican Church in Sydney is predominantly Low Church. It is the Low Church or Evangelical Church which has had <strong>considerable historical influence</strong> in the development of religious expression in Australia due to the prominence of the Anglican Church in <strong>colonial times in NSW</strong>.

										<div class="footnote">Origins</div>                                     
									    <div class="text">The Catholic Church teaches of itself that it is historically and in terms of its teaching in line and continuity with that of the <strong>first disciples of Jesus</strong>. It is the largest and most widespread of all the Christian denominations.

										<div class="footnote">Principal beliefs</div>                                     
									    <div class="text">A key belief of the Catholic Church is that God's teachings have been preserved and safeguarded through the <strong>guidance of the Holy Spirit</strong> in the teaching authority of the Church. In particular this authority is exercised through the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, the Pope, currently <strong>Pope Benedict XVI</strong>. The Bishops of the local Churches, known as Dioceses, exercise this authority in unity with the Pope.

									<div class="text">
								Catholics believe there is a direct and unbroken line from the Apostle Peter as the first <strong>Bishop of Rome</strong> to his current successor Benedict XVI. Catholics also believe in an historic episcopate with each Bishop continuing in a <strong>direct line from the Apostles</strong> who are regarded as the first groups of Bishops of the Church.

									    <div class="text">Throughout history when the Church faced significant questions and challenges it has assembled the leaders of the Church in councils known as <strong>Ecumenical Councils</strong>. The most recent of these councils was the <strong>Second Vatican Council</strong> held from 1962 - 1965. Many of the priorities and directions of the Catholic Church in recent decades have stemmed from the documents of Vatican II. It included important statements on Liturgy, Priesthood, Ecumenism, Religious Freedom, the Role of the Church in the Modern World and the role of the Laity.</p>

							          that the <strong>tradition of the Church</strong> has an indispensable
							          role in interpreting and explaining the
							          meaning of sacred scripture. The teaching tradition of the Church
							          is regarded as an important element within the Catholic Church.
							          Catholics regard Scripture and Tradition as two pillars which
							          work hand in hand to explain the central elements of Catholic

									        sacraments</strong> which
									      are celebrated in the Church. 


These are Baptism, Penance Eucharist, Confirmation, Matrimony, Holy Orders and
Anointing of the Sick. Of these sacraments, <strong>Eucharist</strong> is considered
to be the source and summit of the Christian life. Accordingly it plays a <strong>central

									    <div class="text">Whether standing alone as a single congregation or being affiliated with other similar Churches Pentecostals have a number of distinguishing features. They are generally characterized by lively worship and an emphasis on the <strong>gifts of the Holy Spirit</strong> such as prophecy, healing and speaking in tongues.

								<div class="content2">
										<div class="footnote">Demographics</div>                                     
									    <div class="text">Another feature of many Pentecostal Churches is their belief that they are living in the final days before the second coming of Christ, the <strong>parousia</strong>. Consequently, in many Pentecostal services there is a strong emphasis on preaching about the end of the world.
									  Many Pentecostal congregations are quite small in numbers which allows for a closer and more <strong>personal sense of community</strong>. In contrast, a number of Pentecostal groups now attract large numbers in stadium like gatherings.

<p></p>In comparison to other Christian denominations many Pentecostal congregations have comparably <strong>young congregations</strong>. The majority of Pentecostal Christians have previously belonged to other Christian denominations, mostly Protestant.

								  <div class="text">While the Pastors of Pentecostal Churches may have authority in their own congregation there is little <strong>authority or established doctrine</strong> outside of the individual congregation. The commonalities among Pentecostal Churches depend on a similar interpretation of certain biblical texts rather than any formalised or centralised doctrine.</p>

<p>Pentecostal Churches are also less inclined to have formalised rituals than other Christian denominations. There are usually no sacraments or equivalent rituals practised in Pentecostal Churches although some customs relating to <strong>prayers for conversion</strong>, repentance and healing may include ritual elements.
