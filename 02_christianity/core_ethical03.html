								<div class="footnote">Importance of ethical teaching in the life of adherents </div>                                     
								<div class="text">Followers of the Christian religion can be expected to place considerable value on the ethical teachings of the tradition in determining their response to a wide range of issues. These teachings <strong>provide guidance</strong> which enable to adherents of Christianity to make <strong>informed moral choices</strong> according to the principles of the tradition.
								<p>The guidance that is provided and the way in which adherents respond can be in <strong>general or specific terms </strong>and may be in a <strong>direct sense</strong> or through a <strong>broad overall direction</strong>.
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">General guidance</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In the first instance the <strong>general direction</strong> of life for adherents of the Christian tradition will be provided through examples such as the <strong>Ten Commandments</strong> (Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21), <strong>The Beatitudes</strong> (Matthew 5:2-12 and Luke 6:20-26) and <strong>the Golden Rule</strong> (Matthew 7:12 and Luke 6:31). Texts such as these can be seen as the <strong>foundational principles</strong> underpinning the Christian ethical system. Accordingly it would be expected that Christians would strive to live their lives in line with the principles espoused in such passages. In this way it can be seen that the ethical teaching of Christianity provides <strong>broad, overall guidance </strong>to the followers of the tradition.
 								  </div> 
								<div class="footnote">Life and ministry of Jesus </div>                                     
								<div class="text">Another form of ethical guidance for Christians is found through the use of the <strong>example of the life and ministry of Jesus</strong>. Christians seek to model their lives on the life and ministry of Jesus and as such the ethical standards practised by Jesus in the course of his life become <strong>guides for the actions of Christians</strong>. In general terms the Christian ethos of caring for those in need can be directly attributed to the <strong>example of Jesus</strong>. Other examples from the life and ministry of Jesus include opposition to oppression and advocacy for the vulnerable together with qualities such as<strong> love and forgiveness</strong>.</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Specific guidance </div>                                     
								<div class="text">On a more specific level guidance is also given through the <strong>teaching of the Christian tradition</strong> in relation to <strong>current ethical issues</strong>.
								<p>Traditionally Christianity has been depicted as presenting ethical teaching on a fairly narrow range of issues usually associated with <strong>sexual morality and bio-ethics</strong>. While it is true that sexual morality and bio-ethics have been the focus of a considerable amount of Christian ethical teaching they are far from the only areas of concern.
								<p>Other areas of concern in recent times have been in the field of <strong>international economics</strong> including debt, trade and other instances of business ethics. <strong>Ecological concerns</strong> have also been the focus of a considerable amount of ethical teaching in the Christian tradition as has the use of force <strong>international conflicts</strong>.
								<p>In general terms Christian ethical teaching in areas such as sexual morality and bio ethics has been in line with <strong>conservative forces</strong> in society. In contrast the ethical teaching on issues of economic, ecological and military significance are more in line with <strong>progressive elements</strong> in society.
								<p>This diversity makes it difficult to gauge the effect of Christian ethical teaching in an overall sense. In reality it is common to find examples of Christian adherents embracing the teaching on one issue while rejecting it on another.  
								<p>Thus while Christian adherents are usually influenced by Christian ethical teaching in terms of <strong>broad principles </strong>there is a great deal of diversity in the acceptance of ethical teaching on <strong>specific contemporary issues</strong>.
