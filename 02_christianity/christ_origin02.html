								<div class="footnote">Jesus did not intend to found a new religion</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Jesus is typically known as the founder of Christianity.  Yet, Jesus was born a Jew, lived as a Jew and died a Jew. Jesus sought to renew Judaism in the spirit of the prophets by opposing the legalism of Judaism during his time and calling people to return to the demands of the covenant. There is no evidence to suggest that he intended to found a new religion. Given that he sought only to renew Judaism from within it is not surprising that he left very few instructions except to preach, baptise, heal the sick, feed the poor and forgive.</div>

									<div class="footnote">Reign of God</div>                                     
									<div class="text">The main focus of Jesus' preaching was the <b>reign (kingdom) of God</b>, which is understood as God's vision or dream for humankind. The reign of God envisages a world where God's values (love, peace, cooperation, tolerance and justice) are realised. Essentially, Jesus sought to show how this could be done. By announcing this reign of God Jesus was inaugurating it and inviting others to join in its development. The reign of God will reach completion at the end of time when God's dream for humankind becomes a reality. Until then it is the responsibility of the followers of Jesus to live in accordance with these values and to lead others to them. </div>

									<div class="footnote">Principal events in the life of Jesus </div>                                     
									<div class="text">Much of what we know about Jesus is derived from the Gospels. Even though the Gospels were not written to provide a historical explanation of the life of Jesus the Gospels do provide an <b>historical framework</b> through which we can examine the principal events in the life of Jesus. Traditionally Jesus is believed to have been born of a virgin in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth. Modern scholarship suggests that the infancy narratives were written to make <b>theological statements</b> about
									  Jesus' heritage. These statements emphasise the claim that Jesus is
									  the Messiah. Historically Jesus is known to have travelled from Nazareth
									  to Galilee, where he was baptised by John the Baptist. He then preached
									  around the region of Galilee and attracted disciples some of whom
									  were women. Jesus began this ministry when he was about thirty years
									  old little is known of his life before this time. Jesus taught in
								    parables mostly concerning the <b>reign of God</b>. In essence this mes									sage challenged the temporal and the material and consequently Jesus attracted a significant following from those who were socially disadvantaged. Frequently, the Gospels depict Jesus as a <b>healer or a miracle worker</b> as a way of highlighting the power of God in action. Jesus' preaching brought him into conflict with the Jewish authorities.</div>

								<div class="content2">
									<div class="footnote">Pharisees</div>                                     
									<div class="text">The clash between Jesus and the Pharisees however, reflects the situation at the time the Gospels were written rather than the situation at the time of Jesus. At the time of the writing of the gospels conflict existed between the Christians and the Pharisees because the Pharisees regarded the Christian sect as heretical. Thus when we read of the conflict between Jesus and the Pharisees we are reading something that is more a reflection of the <b>times of the gospel writer</b> rather than the situation that prevailed a generation earlier during the life and ministry of Jesus.

								<div class="content2">
									<div class="footnote">Death and resurrection</div>                                     
									<div class="text">Jesus' ministry took him to Jerusalem, where he stayed for the Passover. He was arrested and sentenced to <b>death by crucifixion</b>. He was placed in a tomb on the eve of the Passover and appeared to his disciples after being <b>raised on the third day</b>.
									</div>

								<div class="content2">
									<div class="footnote">Gospels written so that people would believe</div>                                     
									<div class="text">Even though the Gospels provide a historical framework by which we can analyse the principal events in the life of Jesus it is important to remember that the Gospels were not written with the intent of providing an accurate historical explanation of the life of Jesus. 
									</div> 
								</div>
								
								<div class="content2">
									<div class="footnote">Modern Biblical hermeneutics</div>                                     
									<div class="text">The <b>synoptic problem</b>, which describes the attempts to understand the relationship between the synoptic gospels, highlights the point that the gospels were written for different target audiences. Thus it is futile to attempt to form a composite picture of the historical Jesus by ironing out the contradictions in the Gospel. In the same way, the achievements of modern <b>biblical scholarship</b> show us that each Gospel should be appreciated on its own as it reflects the needs of a particular <b>target audience</b>. Consequently, we need to be wary of attempts to examine the historical events in the gospel accounts in the life of Jesus as a precise way of studying the life of the <b>historical Jesus</b>.</p><p></p>
