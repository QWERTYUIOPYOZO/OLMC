									<h1>Content Description </h1>

								<div class="text">The major source of ethical guidance for Christians is the New Testament which contains the Gospels. Thus, the teachings of Jesus Christ lie at the core of Christian ethics. Additionally, the Ten Commandments, contained in the Old Testament, and also know as the <strong>Decalogue</strong> are an important source of ethical guidance for Christians. There are two versions of the <strong>Ten</strong> <strong>Commandments</strong> in the Old Testament. One is found in <strong>Exodus 20:1-17</strong> and the other in <strong>Deuteronomy 5:6-21</strong>. 
								<p>Given that Christianity branched off from its parent religion Judaism, it is not surprising to find that the two tradition share common elements of scripture, namely the Tenach or the Old Testament. The ten commandments are at the heart of the <strong>covenant</strong> tradition in the Old Testament and provide and important <strong>background and context</strong> for the ethical teaching of Jesus found in the New Testament 
 								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Nature of the Ten Commandments</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The first two commandments state the importance of <strong>worshipping
								    God</strong> and God alone. Accordingly the use of magic and the
								    worship of idols are forbidden. The third
								    commandment relates to the importance of <strong>observing the Sabbath</strong> and
								    keeping it sacred for God. The nature of
								    the relationship between God and human beings
								    mirrors the path that human beings should
								    take when relating and interacting with each
								    other. The remaining seven commandments present <strong>guidelines
								    for human interaction</strong> and
								    how human beings should treat each other.
								    These commandments emphasise the importance
								    of human life and the need to respect family
								    and personal integrity.

								<div class="footnote">Importance of the Ten Commandments</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The Ten Commandments are a succinct <strong>summary of Christian ethics</strong>. They are frequently used as a framework for the <strong>key principles</strong> of Christian ethics. The Ten Commandments were not explicitly prominent in the teaching of the early Church possibly because Jesus did not explicitly cite each of the commandments. However, he did use the Ten Commandments as a backdrop for his own ethical teachings. Not only did he refer to and make use of these commandments in his teaching, he also used them as a means to highlight the requirements of the <strong>new covenant</strong>. This use of the commandments is particularly evident in his sermon on the mount (Mt 5-7) which is a foundational element of New Testament ethical teaching.
