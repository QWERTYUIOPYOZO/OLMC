									<h1>Content Description</h1>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote"></div> 
								<div class="text">"I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6). Excerpts such as this one from John's gospel and many other similar statements reflect the core of the Christian understanding of salvation.  
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Christian belief in salvation</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Expressed in its most simple terms Christians believe that salvation is offered as a <strong>gift from God</strong> through the death and resurrection of Jesus. Access to this gift of salvation comes <strong>through faith</strong> in Jesus.
								<p>These simple expressions of salvation are universally accepted by Christians. However, in practice there is considerable difference in its understanding among Christian groups.
 								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Personal faith</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								The groups of Christians known as "<strong>born again</strong>" Christians believe that salvation is achieved through an individual's personal acceptance of Jesus Christ as <strong>Lord and Saviour</strong> in a moment of <strong>personal conversion</strong>. They regard this moment as being "born again". Such Christians would regard such a personal conversion as the only possible way of achieving salvation. This belief is based on the Johannine account of Jesus' encounter with Nicodemus. (John 3:1-8)
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Good works </div>                                     
								<div class="text">In contrast to this view other Christians who wish to highlight the obligation to act on behalf of the poor and dispossessed would refer to the accounts of the <strong>day of judgement</strong> where Jesus separates the "sheep from the goats" (Matthew 25:31-46). The key indicator of salvation here is not personal faith but the way a person has treated the 'least of these" (Matthew 25:40).</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Faith and good works</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In between these views lies the understanding that the requirement is a <strong>sincere faith</strong> which is <strong>enlivened with good works</strong>. This is similar in sentiment to the ideas expressed in the letter of James where the writer claims that faith without works is dead (James 2:17)  
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Jewish roots of Christian belief in salvation</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In an historical sense, the Christian understanding of salvation draws deeply from the <strong>Jewish tradition</strong> of Moses and the Exodus. In this monumental event, the Hebrew people experienced the saving intervention of God taking them from slavery and setting them free. From this foundational experience, the Jewish tradition of a God involved in human concerns was born. It also taught the Hebrews that God's <strong>saving action</strong> was one of<strong> liberation</strong>.
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Anawim</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The Prophetic tradition of the Hebrew scriptures continues to call the people of Israel to be faithful to their <strong>covenental relationship</strong> with God. In particular the prophets remind the people of their obligation to care for the <strong>anawim</strong> who are the poor and defenceless members of society. The prophets remind the people of God's liberating intervention in their slavery and call them to avoid any actions that will lead to a <strong>loss of liberty</strong> for themselves and for others. In this call there is particular obligation to be advocates on the part of the most vulnerable members of the community.
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Jesus is the fufilment of the promise of salvation</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In his own preaching, Jesus identifies closely with the Hebrew <strong>prophetic tradition</strong>. In fact in announcing the time of salvation he emphatically identifies himself as the fulfilment of the <strong>promise of salvation</strong>.
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Central elements of belief in salvation</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In this brief survey of salvation history Christians recognise the central elements of their understanding of salvation. Firstly that <strong>God is the one who saves</strong>. Secondly that <strong>God's saving action is liberating</strong> and has a particular concern for those who are the most vulnerable in society. Thirdly that Jesus in his life and ministry <strong>embodies the saving action of God</strong>. Finally that Christians are called to accept the gift of God's saving action through their faith in Jesus and their own actions on behalf of those in need.
