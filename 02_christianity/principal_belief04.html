								<div class="footnote">God is revealed to humankind through human history</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Christians believe that God is revealed to human kind in and through the <strong>experiences of human history</strong>. God is understood to be intimately involved with all aspects of human life and accordingly human beings learn about God through <strong>divine revelation</strong> which occurs continuously as God relates to human kind and indeed to all of creation.  
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">God is the source of revelation </div>                                     
								<div class="text">Christians understand that <strong>God is the source of revelation</strong>. In other words it is a <strong>self revelation</strong> of God that provides the knowledge of the divine encountered in human experience. While there is only one <strong>source of revelation</strong>, this revelation takes place through a number of related vehicles. 
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Holy Spirit</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The first of these vehicles is <strong>God's own Spirit</strong> dwelling within human beings. The Spirit enlivens the faith of Christians and brings to them a <strong>knowledge of God</strong>. The role of the Holy Spirit is paramount in the process of revelation as the Spirit <strong>inspires and guides</strong> Christians in all things. The Holy Spirit has inspired the writing of the Christian sacred text, <strong>the Bible</strong> and continually inspires the Christian Church to teach in fidelity to the truth of the Bible.</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Bible</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The second vehicle through which revelation is communicated is the <strong>sacred text</strong>, the Bible. Christians believe that the Bible is inspired by God and as such is the <strong>normative text</strong> for Christian life. Different groups within the Christian tradition understand this inspiration in different ways, however, all Christian groups believe that the Bible is the fundamental and normative text.   
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Teaching tradition of Church</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The third vehicle is the <strong>teaching tradition</strong> of the Church. In the course of history the Church has continually taught in the name of God and Christians believe that this teaching tradition is also <strong>inspired by the Holy Spirit</strong>. Across the various denominations of Christianity there is considerable difference in the understanding of the importance of this tradition. In the Orthodox and Catholic denominations there is a clear emphasis on the role of the teaching tradition of the Church, particularly through the <strong>office of the Pope and the Patriarchs</strong>. In the Protestant denominations there is less emphasis on this role and greater emphasis on the teaching of the Bible in its own right.
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Informal vehicles of revelation</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Other vehicles of revelation can be seen in <strong>less formal</strong> areas such as the understanding of God being <strong>revealed in nature</strong> or in the <strong>loving relationship</strong> between spouses or parent and child. While these vehicles have significance they play a lesser role in Christian understanding to the main vehicles of Scripture and Tradition under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. 
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Revelation is an ongoing process</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Revelation is understood to be an ongoing process and Christians believe that revelation is still <strong>unfolding in human experience</strong>. Some writers have sought to encapsulate this idea by speaking about the Church today writing the "Fifth Gospel" or the "Third Testament". These images help members of the Church today to understand the <strong>ongoing nature of revelation</strong> and to realise that their understanding of God is not simply a matter of studying ancient historical themes.
