									<h1>Content Description</h1>
								<h2>Jesus Inaugurates the Reign of God</h2>	
								<div class="content2">							
								<div class="footnote">Jesus is the embodiment of the reign of God </div>                                     
								<div class="text">Jesus is seen as the model for Christian life through his embodiment of the <b>reign of God</b>. The synoptic gospels portray Jesus as emerging from obscurity in Galilee and announcing the inauguration of the reign of God (Mark 1:14-15). This reign of God, often referred to as the Kingdom of God, can be understood in simple terms as the realisation of God's vision or dream for the world. Jesus' preaching of the reign of God points to a <b>future yet already present</b> reality where the values of love, justice and peace prevail in a world living in accordance with God's plan. The reign of God is central to the preaching of Jesus and is at the heart of his life and ministry.
													Following his death and resurrection Jesus was recognised as the embodiment of the reign of God and those who seek to bring about the reign of God are encouraged to model their lives on the <b>example of Jesus</b>.
													This modeling can be identified according to four significant aspects of Jesus' life and ministry.
								  </div> 
								</div>
							<h2>Jesus lives a life of prayer</h2>
							<div class="content2">
									<div class="footnote">Christians model Jesus' attitude to prayer</div>                                     
									<div class="text">The first significant aspect is the prayerful nature of Jesus' life. The gospel portraits of Jesus show him to be a <b>man of prayer</b>, frequently communing with God in a familiar and intimate manner (Luke 10:21). He often withdraws from the pressures of daily life to pray in a quiet place (Luke 5:16) and does so especially as he approaches key moments in his ministry such as the calling of his disciples (Luke 8:12-15). Jesus' prayer includes the traditions of the <b>Jewish liturgy</b> and often draws on the tradition of the <b>Hebrew Scriptures</b> (Matthew 27:46). Jesus is also found at prayer in times of personal crisis as well as in the face of the needs of others (Matthew 26:39). Finally Jesus teaches his disciples some important principles of prayer and famously he <b>teaches them how to pray</b>. 
									Christians throughout history have closely studied Jesus attitude of prayer and have sought to model their lives on a variety of lessons drawn from Jesus' example.

								<h2>Jesus lives a life of service to others</h2>
								<div class="content2">						
									<div class="footnote">Ministry of Jesus is characterised by service to others </div>                                     
									<div class="text">
									  <p>From the outset, the ministry of Jesus is characterised by service of others. It is notable that the early scenes from the ministry in the synoptic gospels are littered with examples of <b>healing miracles</b> where Jesus seeks to bring the healing <b>power of God</b> into contact with the need of others (Mark 1:23-45). 
									</p>
									  <p>While it appears that Jesus initially saw his ministry as directed
									    solely to the needs of the <b>people of Israel</b>, an encounter
									    with a determined Gentile woman seems
									    to have transformed his understanding (Mark 7:24-30).</p>
									  <p align="left"> A number of the sayings attributed to Jesus including
									    the famous <strong>Beatitudes</strong> (Matthew 5:3-12) and the <strong>Golden
									    Rule</strong> (Matthew 8:12) highlight this attitude of service.</p>
									  Another important example is the account
									  of the last supper in John&rsquo;s gospel where Jesus washes the feet
									  of his disciples as an example of service to one another (John 13:1-15).
									  <p>Christians have always embraced an ethos of
									      service to others and have done so
									    as a direct consequence of the example provided in the life and
									    ministry of Jesus. </p>
									</div> 
								</div>
								<h2>Jesus acts as an advocate for the poor</h2>
								<div class="content2">								
									<div class="footnote">Ministry of Jesus is characterised by advocacy for the needy</div>                                     
									<div class="text">In the Jewish tradition, there is a strong ethical dimension which calls upon people to stand up for the <b>needs of the poor</b> and disadvantaged. This tradition is embraced emphatically in the ministry of Jesus who makes this a central characteristic of his ministry.
									The gospels provide many examples of Jesus taking the side of the <b>poor and oppressed</b> (John 9:1-41). In many cases the cause of the oppression is the harsh requirements of religious observance and Jesus is strident in his indictment of religious extremism which leads to the oppression of those who are vulnerable.
									While <b>advocacy for the poor</b> has always been present in the Christian tradition, recent developments such as <b>Liberation Theology</b> have brought this important dimension into sharper focus. This is particularly so for the majority of Christians who now live among the poorer countries of the world.
								 </div> 
								</div>
								<h2>Jesus loves and forgives others</h2>
								<div class="content2">								
									<div class="footnote">Jesus' attitude of love and forgiveness is a model for Christian life </div>                                     
									<div class="text">The final example which highlights the role of Jesus as a model for Christian life has to do with an attitude of <b>love and forgiveness</b> of others.
								There are numerous examples in the gospels where Jesus' <b>love for others</b> is shown (John 8:2-11). Furthermore he is shown as being ever willing to forgive the failings of others. Most poignantly this is seen in the post resurrection appearances with the disciples who had abandoned him (John 21:1-14) and in the famous prayer for the <b>forgiveness</b> of his own executioners (Luke 23:34).
								Christians have modeled these attributes in a number of ways. Some denominations have incorporated <b>sacraments</b> or other ceremonies to ritualise the importance of forgiveness. Finally the famous prayer, the <b>Lord's Prayer</b> incorporates the petition asking for forgiveness as we also forgive others (Luke 11:4).
