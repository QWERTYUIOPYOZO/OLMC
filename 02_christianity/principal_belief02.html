								<div class="footnote">Jesus died for our sins </div>                                     
								<div class="text">Jesus was <strong>crucified</strong> by the Roman authorities for being a political threat to the Roman Empire. Crucifixion was a form of execution commonly used by the Romans during the first century CE. Christians have traditionally believed that <strong>Jesus died for our sins</strong>. Jesus was sent by God to save all of humankind. This belief that Jesus died for our sins has on numerous occasions given rise to some questionable explanations. The concept that Christ died to save us from sin implicitly suggests that God would be appeased with the execution of an innocent person. Even more questionable is the inference that Jesus became human simply in order for him to be <strong>sacrificed</strong> because Jesus as the perfect example of humankind is the only person of sufficient value to pay this ransom. The unstated suggestion here is that there is a debt which needs to be paid to Satan in order to ransom humankind. This in itself is a dubious proposition.  
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Reflections on the death of Jesus</div>                                     
								<div class="text">More adequate reflections on the idea of Jesus' death include a belief that death itself is an integral part of the <strong>human condition</strong> and one which is <strong>shared by Jesus</strong>. Another way of appreciating the importance of the death of Jesus is by seeing it as an example of the <strong>unconditional love of God</strong>. A further way of examining and understanding the importance of the death of Jesus is by seeing his selflessness even unto death as a clear model for discipleship. At a more symbolic level the death of an innocent person can be recognised as the ultimate consequence of selfishness. 
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Belief in the resurrection is a fundamental tenet of Christianity </div>                                     
								<div class="text">The fundamental Christian belief in the resurrection of the body is based on the <strong>resurrection of Jesus Christ</strong>. This belief is exemplified in the <strong>Nicene Creed</strong>  which testifies not only to the resurrection of Jesus but also to the resurrection of the dead as a fundamental Christian belief. Jesus' resurrection and ascension are depicted slightly differently in the Gospels of John and Luke. John's Gospel depicts the <strong>resurrection, ascension and the descent of the Holy Spirit </strong>as a simultaneous occurrence. Luke separates the event into three distinct occurrences spread over a number of weeks and culminating in the <strong>Pentecost</strong> where the divine is integrated with the human. The resurrection carries the meaning of eternal life which overcomes the limitations of human mortality. </div> 
								<div class="footnote">Nature of risen Jesus</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Theologians have long debated the nature of the <strong>risen Jesus</strong>. Here theologians are caught in a predicament because it is difficult to write about the resurrection of Jesus without denying either some form of a <strong>physical resurrection</strong> or denying some aspect of <strong>spiritual resurrection</strong>. It is difficult to depict the physical resurrection without reference to some form of resuscitation of the human body even though the resurrection is in fact a<strong> transformation</strong>.
