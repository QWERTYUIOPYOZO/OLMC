		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>Power was centred in Jerusalem during first century Judaism</li>
		  <li>Fierce sectarian rivalry existed between the different Jewish sects, particularly between the Pharisees, Sadducees and the Zealots who sought to control the direction of the religion</li>
		  <li>The Messianic expectation, a central tenet of Jewish belief reached a high point during the time of Jesus. Jewish speculation that the Messiah was to be a political saviour was the result of centuries of political oppression by the Romans</li>
		  <li>Jesus who sought to renew the Jewish religion in the spirit of the prophets, came to be seen as the Messiah by his followers</li>

		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Whilst Jesus is typically known as the founder of Christianity, he did not seek to establish a new religion. Rather he intended to oppose the legalism of Judaism and reform the tradition in the spirit of the prophets</li> 
		  <li>The main focus of Jesus' preaching was the reign of God</li>
		  <li>The reign of God envisages a world where God's values such as love, peace and cooperation are realised. This vision, that was inaugurated through Jesus' ministry, will be completed at the end of time. Until then it is the responsibility of the followers of Jesus to live in accordance with these values and to lead others to them. Subsequently, the reign of God is considered to be a present yet future reality</li> 
		  <li>Jesus is believed to have been born of a virgin in Bethlehem</li> 
		  <li>Jesus travelled from Nazareth to Galilee where he was baptised by John the Baptist</li> 
		  <li>He preached around the region of Galilee and attracted disciples some of whom were women and many were socially disadvantaged</li> 
		  <li>Jesus taught in parables mostly concerning the reign of God</li> 
          <li>In the Gospels he is frequently depicted as a healer or a miracle worker</li> 
		  <li>Jesus' preaching brought him into conflict with the Jewish authorities</li>
		  <li>Jesus' ministry took him to Jerusalem where he stayed for the Passover</li> 
		  <li>He was arrested and sentenced to death by crucifixion </li>
		  <li>He was placed in a tomb on the eve of the Passover and appeared to his disciples after being raised on the third day</li>  
		  <li>The synoptic problem and modern biblical scholarship reminds us that the Gospels were written for a particular target audience as a way of passing on the faith of the community rather than with the intent of providing an accurate historical account of the life of Jesus</li>

		<p class="section_statement">Explain why Jesus is the model for Christian life</p>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>Jesus is the model for Christian life because he embodies the reign of God, that is God's dream for humankind that lies at the heart of Jesus' life and ministry</li>  
		  <li>The reign of God refers to the realisation of God's vision for the world, where the values of love, justice and peace prevail. Jesus inaugurated God's dream for the world through his ministry, and showed people how to bring about the reign of God, which will be completed at the end of time</li>    
		  <li>Jesus' embodiment of the reign of God can be identified according to four significant aspects of Jesus' life and ministry: Jesus lives a life of prayer, Jesus lives a life of service to others, Jesus acts as an advocate for the poor and Jesus loves and forgives others</li>   
		  <li>The Gospel portraits of Jesus show him to be a man of prayer, often withdrawing from the pressures of daily life to pray in a quiet place, and does so especially as he approaches key moments in his ministry and during times of personal crisis</li>   
		  <li>Jesus also teaches his disciples some important principles of prayer such as the importance of praying for the needy</li>   
		  <li>The Christian ethos of service to others is the directly modelled upon Jesus' life and ministry which is characterised by its service to others</li>   
		  <li>A number of the sayings attributed to Jesus including the Beatitudes and the Golden Rule highlight this attitude of service</li>  
		  <li>Jesus emphatically identifies with the strong ethical tradition in the Hebrew scriptures by making advocacy for the poor and disadvantaged a central characteristic of his ministry</li>   
		  <li>Whilst advocacy for the poor has always been present in the Christian tradition, recent developments such as Liberation Theology has brought this important dimension into sharper focus</li>   
		  <li>Jesus' attitude of love and forgiveness for the failings of others is most evident firstly in his forgiveness of the disciples who abandoned him and secondly in the famous prayer for the forgiveness of his own executioners</li>   
		  <li>Some denominations have incorporated sacraments and other ceremonies to ritualise the importance of forgiveness</li>   
		  <li>Jesus Christ</li>

		<h3>Students learn to:</h3>
		<p class="section_statement">Describe the early development of Christian communities after the death of Jesus</p> 
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>The Jesus movement which lasted from approximately 30-60 CE describes a period immediately following the death of Jesus where the infant Christian community saw itself as a sect which existed within the Jewish tradition</li>  
		  <li>Little emphasis was placed on laying down the infrastructure of the movement because the followers believed that they were living in the last days before the Parousia, the second coming of Christ.</li>  
		  <li>Small groups of Palestinian Jews followed Jesus through the preaching of disciples such as Peter in and around Palestine</li> 
		  <li>Larger groups of Diaspora Jews and Gentiles responded to the preaching of Paul</li>  
		  <li>Paul is typically considered as the second founder of Christianity because he helped to set up the structure of this new religion and hence confirm the status of Christianity vis-à-vis Judaism</li>  
		  <li>The Council of Jerusalem in 49 CE formally resolved the debate which divided the Pauline and Palestinian groups. The Council accepted Paul's argument that Gentiles need not undergo circumcision in order to become Christians. This Council is an attempt to overcome differences within the infant Church. Despite the formal resolution of the problem the tensions between the two early communities continued for some time</li>    
		  <li>The New Testament period which lasted from approximately 45 to 100 CE saw the gradual formalisation and centralisation of the Christian Churches which meant that this new religion was increasingly seen as distinct and separate from Judaism. The need to institutionalise the charism of the movement came about as a result of the delay of the Parousia and the death of the Apostles</li>  
		  <li>In the 2nd and 3rd century Christians were persecuted by Jews and Romans alike</li>
