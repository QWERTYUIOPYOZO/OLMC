									<h1>Content Description</h1>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Key source of ethical guidance is the New Testament</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The fundamental source of ethical guidance for Christians is the <strong>New Testament</strong>. The New Testament contains some of Jesus' most significant ethical statements. That is, the requirement to <strong>love God</strong> with all your heart, soul and strength and to <strong>love your neighbour</strong> as yourself, and the requirement that love is the basic condition of the Christian life. The voluminous mass of Christian ethics can be distilled into these core principles.       
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Beatitudes </div>                                     
								<div class="text">The <strong>Beatitudes</strong> are regarded as a foundational
								  passage for Christian ethics. The Beatitudes
								  is the name given to the famous and definitive
								  part of the <strong>Sermon
								  on the Mount</strong>.
								  The Beatitudes, as noted in Matthew 5:2-12
								  


and Luke 6:20-26 the <strong> Sermon on the Plain, </strong>describes a life
directed towards saintliness and holiness. Thus, the
Beatitudes provide a model or a template for the Christian life. 
								<p>The Beatitudes provide an ethical stance which stands in contrast to the <strong>dominant culture</strong>. They point to an <strong>inversion of values</strong> whereby the things that are often regarded as having no value according to the dominant culture are celebrated and affirmed in the <strong>reign of God</strong>. In another sense they provide a warning against an approach to life which values only material <strong>strength and power</strong>. The inference is that such values are <strong>illusory and temporary</strong>.
 								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Sermon on the Mount</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The <strong>Sermon on the Mount</strong> provides other
								  important guidance for <strong>Christian ethics</strong>. For example
								  Luke 6:27 asks us to "Love your enemies, do good to those who hate
								  you". Similarly Matthew 5:39 instructs us that "When a person strikes
								  you on the right cheek, turn and offer him the other". In essence,
								  Christian ethics can be summed up as "Do unto others as you would have
								  them do unto you". (Matthew 7:12 and Luke 6:31) This passage, known
								  as the <strong>golden rule</strong>, is the key concept which underpins
								  all Christian ethical teachings. </div> 
								<div class="footnote">Jesus' commandment of love </div>                                     
								<div class="text">Jesus' commandment of love can be distilled into two categories,<strong> love of God and love of neighbour</strong>. Christianity draws on two central texts of the <strong>Old Testament </strong>to understand the covenantal notions of love of God and love of neighbour. Leviticus 19:18 advises the reader to "Love your neighbour as yourself". Deuteronomy 6:4-6 urges the reader to "Hear O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is One. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts". Mark 12:31 affirms that "there is <strong>no commandment greater than these</strong>".     
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Love of neighbour is taken to a new level </div>                                     
								<div class="text">In the ministry of Jesus this commandment to <strong>love your neighbour </strong>is raised to a new level when Jesus says that, "You have heard that it was said, 'love your neighbour and hate your enemy'. But I tell you 'Love your <strong>enemies</strong> and pray for those who persecute you". (Matthew 5:43-44) Thus Christians are called to model their lives on the love of Jesus which in itself fulfils the requirement of love. Paul notes that love is the element which <strong>fulfils the law</strong>. </div> 
								<div class="footnote">Love is the identifying characteristic of the Christian life </div>                                     
								<div class="text">The requirement to love is conveyed in terms of a new
								  commandment in John's Gospel. To love one another, as God loves each
								  person is seen as the<strong> identifying characteristic of the Christian
								  life</strong> which sets Christians apart from the rest of the world.
								  The Gospel of John instructs Christians; "A new command I give you:
								  love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
								  By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one
								  another". (John 13:34-35) To love is to share the essence of God, as
								  seen in 1 John 4:7-8, "Dear
								  friends, let us love one another, for love
								  comes from God. Everyone who loves has been
								  born of God and knows God.


Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love &rdquo;. Christians
see in Jesus&rsquo; example of love the model which they are to follow. Jesus&rsquo; love
is a love without limits, a sacrificial love which is seen in his self giving
on the cross.
<p>Similarly, Paul identifies love as the <strong>essential quality</strong> that gives life and meaning to all other virtues. In other words, all other virtues are futile, when they are separated from love. Thus, he calls Christians to live a life motivated by love. This can be seen in the famous and oft-quoted passage, 1 Corinthians 13.  "I can speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not love I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal". Thus, Jesus' commandment of love offers fundamental guidance for Christians in the area of ethics. 
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Differences in the application of general Biblical principles</div>                                     
								<div class="text">There are no identifiable differences among the various Christian denominations concerning their understanding of Jesus' commandment of love since all Christian denominations base their <strong>ethical guidance</strong> on <strong>Biblical teachings</strong>. There are some differences, however, regarding the application of these principles to particular ethical issues. But these differences are not overly significant. This difference stems from the fact that the Catholic and Orthodox denominations place a greater emphasis on the teaching tradition of the Church. Ethical teaching among the Protestant denominations is more directly linked to Biblical teaching. Hence there is a more direct application of the Biblical principles in Protestant Churches.</div>
