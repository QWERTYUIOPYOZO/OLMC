								<div class="footnote">Belief in the Trinity is a central tenet of Christianity</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Christians believe that God is <strong>omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent</strong>. In other words, God is all-knowing, all powerful and always present. Christians also believe that <strong>God is One</strong> but embodied in <strong>three persons</strong>, God the Father, Jesus the Son and the Holy Spirit as sanctifier. Belief in the Trinity is a central tenet of Christianity. God's promise of salvation has been fulfilled through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. In other words, God is revealed as the trinity. God the Father is revealed in the Hebrew Scriptures, God the Son in the Christian scriptures and God the Spirit is revealed through the Church.

								  <p>Trinitarian doctrine</p>
								</div>                                     
								<div class="text">This plurality in God is evident in the way Jesus calls God "abba" which means Father. Similarly early Christian practice indicates a liturgical use of this <strong>Trinitarian formula</strong>, "In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit". The Trinitarian doctrine states that there are three <strong>co-eternal</strong>, equal persons in one God. This doctrine was further developed and defined at the councils of <strong>Nicaea in 325 CE and Constantinople in 381 CE</strong>. The difficulty is reconciling monotheism with the notion of the three persons.   
								<p>The various heresies and the councils which followed reflect a process of refining the <strong>understanding of the relationship</strong> between the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. In the fourth century there was considerable debate and discussion on how <strong>God was One and yet also three persons</strong>. In other words, how can unity co-exist with the notion of trinity? As this issue was debated a further question emerged, that is, the question of whether God is three only in terms of economy or is God three at an intra-divine level (immanence). 
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Cappadocian theology</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In response to this, during the second half of the fourth century, the <strong>Cappadocian Fathers</strong> led by people such as Basil the Great, Bishop of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory, the younger brother of Basil, Bishop of Nyssa, made important contributions. These theologians claimed that God was of <strong>one essence</strong> (ousia) but<strong> three separate and distinct person</strong>s (hypostaseis). This divine essence is expressed through its embodiment in all three persons. It follows then that because there is a single divine essence which unites the three persons, the three persons actually dwell within each other, a state known as <strong>circumincession</strong>. 
								<p>Furthermore, because the three persons are of one essence the actions of any particular person can be attributed to all persons. However, whilst this divine essence and nature is a common denominator for all three persons, the three persons had <strong>unique attributes</strong> which distinguished them. That is, fatherhood for the Father, sonship for the Son and sanctifying power for the Holy Spirit. Implicitly, Cappadocian theology adopts the concept of <strong>mutual relations</strong> which is the idea that the terms Father and Son are not names or titles but rather <strong>expressions of a relationship</strong>. For example, the Father is only Father in relation to the Son. 
								<p>Whilst there is a numerical order in the procession of Father, Son and Spirit, such an order does not imply "greater than" or "before" in a temporal sense. In fact, Cappadocian theology asserts the notion that all three persons are <strong>co-equal and co-eternal</strong>. The notion that the three persons are co-eternal means that there was never a time when the Son and the Spirit did not exist alongside the Father. The notional of co-equality suggests that the notion of trinity is compatible with the concept of unity within community. 
								<p>In the development of this Trinitarian theology the West tended to focus on the immanent trinity, that is, the interrelationship between the Father, the Son and the Spirit. The East on the other hand, tended to focus on economic trinity, that is, the role of trinity in relation to ourselves. 
								<p>These differences in the conceptualisation of the Trinity between the East and the West continued in the <strong>filioque controversy</strong>. Essentially, this debate is concerned with whether the Father breathes forth the Holy Spirit through the Son, as the East argues or whether both Father and Son breathe forth the Spirit, as Western Christianity claims.
