									<h2>Outline the principal beliefs regarding the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ</h2>							
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Christological controversies</div>                                     
								<div class="text">During the fourth and fifth centuries controversy raged over the issue of the humanity and the divinity of Jesus Christ and the subsequently to the relationship of Jesus to God and Mary. These debates are known as the <strong>Christological controversies</strong>. The issue at the heart of the debate is essentially how Jesus can be fully human as well as fully God? The Christological controversies demonstrate that over emphasising either his divinity or his humanity leads to a distorted picture of Jesus Christ.
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Docetism</div>                                     
								<div class="text">One of the earliest views given on the issue of the divinity and the humanity of Jesus Christ is what is known as the Docetist position. <strong>Docetism</strong> is the view that Jesus was fully divine however he was not truly human. Docetism claimed that Jesus was God but merely had the <strong>appearance of being human</strong>. This doctrine clearly undermined the integrity of the humanity of Jesus and accordingly was rejected by orthodox Christians  
								</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Arianism</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Another prevalent view on the issue of the divinity and humanity of Jesus is a position known as <strong>Arianism</strong>. Arianism is the belief that Jesus is superior to the rest of creation but is less divine than God and hence Jesus was not actually God. Arianism is so called because of<strong> Arius</strong> who most influentially espoused this view. Arius reasoned that because Jesus was created he could not be eternal unlike God who is eternal and hence Jesus cannot be <strong>equal to God</strong>. Arius taught that only the Father was God even though his Son could reveal God to humanity. Arianism led to a divisive dispute in the early Christian Church. It was formally resolved by the <strong>Council of Nicaea in 325 CE </strong>which concluded that Jesus was of <strong>one substance</strong> with the Father the implication being that Jesus was <strong>fully divine as well as being fully human</strong>. 
								The Council of Constantinople reaffirmed the decision reached by the Council of Nicaea.</div> 
								<div class="footnote">Nestorius</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In the fifth century <strong>Nestorius</strong> claimed that there were <strong>two separate persons</strong> within Jesus, a divine person and a human person. Mary was the mother of the human Jesus but not the divine Jesus. The inference of Nestorius' claims about Mary was to undermine the integrity of the person of Jesus. The <strong>Council of Ephesus in 431</strong> CE reinforced the view that Christ is fully human as well as being fully divine. It follows therefore that Mary is the Mother of God (<strong>theotokos</strong>) as well being the mother of the human Jesus.
