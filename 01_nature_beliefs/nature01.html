					<h1>Content Description</h1>
					<h2>Define the supernatural dimension</h2>
					<div class="content2">
							<div class="footnote">Belief in the supernatural dimension is central to all world religions </div>                                     
							<div class="text">Religion by its nature defies precise definition. However, the central commonality to all world religions is the belief in the supernatural dimension. Thus, it can be said that the <strong>most significant element</strong> of a religious worldview is this belief in a <strong>divine being</strong> or <strong>power</strong>, which is <strong>greater than humankind</strong> and the <strong>natural world</strong>. This being or power is believed to be responsible for the creation of the world, for providing a moral framework for human life and being the ultimate destiny of a human person at the end of their mortal life. </div> 
					</div>
					<div class="content2">
							<div class="footnote"> Different responses to supernatural dimension </div>                                     
							<div class="text"> Different religions have their own unique responses to the question of the exact nature of the supernatural dimension. The Semitic religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam believe that the supernatural dimension is a single divine being or power. This doctrine or belief is known as monotheism. The two Eastern religions, Hinduism and Buddhism, derive from an understanding of a number of divine beings or powers, a belief known as polytheism. Despite these differences, the belief in the existence of beings or powers beyond the realm of the natural world is an important defining element of a religious worldview. </div>
					</div>
					<h2>Discuss a transcendent religious worldview, which has a belief in a divine power and/or powers beyond the human</h2>
					<p>                                    
							A transcendent worldview is one which has a belief in a divine power or powers 
							beyond the human. The three Semitic religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam emphasise the 
							idea of God being revealed to humankind from beyond the human spirit. For example, Muslims 
							believe that the will of Allah has been revealed to the Prophet Mohammed and is contained in 
							the writings of the Koran. This is a transcendent worldview because the divine being is seen 
							to be separate and outside of the human and revealed to humankind through an intermediary. 
					</p>
					<h2>Discuss an immanent religious worldview which has a belief in a divine being or powers dwelling within the individual</h2>
					<p>                                    
							An immanent worldview holds the belief that supernatural powers or divine 
							beings dwell within the human. For the two Eastern religions, Hinduism and Buddhism, the 
							emphasis is on the finding of truth from within the human spirit. For example Buddhists follow 
							the Eightfold Path prescribed by the Buddha in order to reach Enlightenment. This is an immanent 
							religious worldview because the divine power is believed to be found within the human and awaits 
							discovery through following the prescribed path.
