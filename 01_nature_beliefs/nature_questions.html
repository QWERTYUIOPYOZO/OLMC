										<li>Name ONE religious tradition and describe ONE of its core beliefs (2 marks, 40 words)</li> 
										<li>Describe ONE way that a religious view of reality differs from other views of reality (2 marks, 40 words)</li>

										</ul> 
											<h2>Sample Responses</h2>
											<h3>Analyse the interaction between religion and culture</h3>
											<p>Culture and religion are interrelated and since there is constant dialogue between culture and religion, culture and religion exert both conservative and progressive influences on each other. This is because firstly, religion can only be expressed through a particular cultural setting, and secondly because culture is a fluid, dynamic entity. 
										<p>The most common perception regarding the influence of religion on culture is that religion is a conservative force which attempts to halt rapid social change in favour of traditional values and incremental change. This view stems from the outspoken opposition from different religions to issues such as extramarital sexual activities, homosexuality, euthanasia, and stem cell research. However, religion can also be seen to exert a progressive influence on society. This can most readily be seen in its proactive stance on protecting refugees, indigenous and environmental rights and opposition to military action. 
										<p>Culture can also exert a conservative influence on society. For example, Theravadan Sanga, a division within Buddhism in Thailand, does not allow women to become abbesses because the men have been conditioned to accept the traditional view of restricting women's roles. Hence, religion often reflects cultural and societal values. On the other hand, culture also offers a progressive influence on religion. The technological emphasis in Soka Gakkai, which is also a Buddhist association, is a reflection of the influence of industrialisation on religion.
