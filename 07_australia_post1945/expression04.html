		<h1>Content Description </h1>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p><b> Interfaith dialogue</b> is formal
		    discussion aimed towards developing greater <b>mutual understanding</b> between <b>different
		    religious traditions</b>. It rejects the belief that all religions
		    are the same, and is not an attempt to unify different religious traditions,
		    but while respecting the diversity of beliefs it allows different religions
		    to come to a better appreciation of the uniqueness of each other.</p>
		  Interfaith dialogue is not a forum for debate or evangelisation, fundamental
		  disagreements about beliefs are accepted, and no attempt is made to try and
		  prove the superiority of one belief system over another. However, from such
		  discussions some <b>common grounds</b> may be found between religions.
		  Through building such relationships, different religions may choose to work
		  together on common projects, have <b>interfaith prayer services</b>,
		  and <b>stand publicly united</b> on significant issues. </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Range of interfaith initiatives</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Interfaith dialogue occurs across a range of different levels. In 1996 <b>Pope
		    John Paul II held an interfaith prayer service</b> in the Domain in
		    Sydney. In 2001 churches, synagogues and mosques in Sydney held reciprocal
		    visits to pray for peace and express unity. Other examples of coming
		    together include <b>interfaith prayer services</b> commemorating
		    the <b>Bali</b><b> bombing</b> and
		    the <b>Boxing Day Tsunami</b>.</p>
		  <p>Similarly, different religious traditions
		      work together on a range of social issues as a testament to many
		    of the shared values underlying major religious traditions. Different religious
		    traditions cooperate on issues such as poverty, unemployment, industrial
		    rights, indigenous rights, land mines, nuclear testing and asylum seekers.
		    Interfaith dialogue also takes place regularly on a local or grass roots
		    level. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Specific examples of interfaith dialogue</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The <b>NSW Council of Christians and Jews</b> was started in
		    1989. Activities include an annual Passover demonstration directed
		    to non-Jewish audiences; panel discussions and seminars on current topics
		    of relevance and evenings of multi-denominational poetry and music; Holocaust
		    education; and an annual Christian commemorative service for the
		    Holocaust held in the crypt of St Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral.</p>
		  <p>The <b> Columban Centre for Christian-Muslim Relations</b> was
              established in Sydney in 1997. It has two main objectives: to foster
              relationships with the Muslim community; and to address the misconceptions,
              lack of understanding and stereotyping, which exist in the Christian
              community. The Centre organises dialogues between Christians and
		    Muslims in order for them to meet and learn about each others beliefs and
		    practices, functions as a resource for information, provides Muslim and
		    Christian speakers for different groups, organizes seminars, and publishes
		    a newsletter. </p>

		<div class="footnote"><p>Importance of interfaith dialogue</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> Australia is an <b>increasingly pluralistic society</b> in
		    the sense that it is multi-cultural and multi-faith. Interfaith dialogue
		    creates <b>respect and appreciation for religious diversity </b>which
		    is essential for harmony and peace.</p>
		  <p> Historical and ongoing religious conflicts and persecution have often
		    led to prejudice between religions that if not addressed can lead to division
		    within the Australian community. Examples of such <b>inter-religious
		    conflict</b>, that have affected ethnic communities within Australia,
		    include Muslims versus Jews (e.g. Palestine-Israel), Jews versus Christians
		    (Pogroms in Russia), Christians versus Muslims (the Crusades & the
		    Gulf Wars), Muslims versus Hindus (Pakistan-India), Hindus versus Buddhists
		    (Sri Lanka), Buddhist versus Christian (Vietnam).</p>
		  <p> Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, the wars in Afghanistan
		    and Iraq, and the ongoing 'War on Terror', the <b>Muslim
		    community </b>in Australia has been subjected to <b>suspicion
		    and persecution</b>. Interfaith dialogue has been an important method
		    of <b>working to break down the stereotypes and prejudice</b> towards
		    Muslims.</p>
		  Interfaith dialogue is also important to <b>build relationships between
		  different religions</b> so they can more often and more effectively <b>speak
		  out on common issues</b> and uphold shared values such as the dignity
		  of the person, the sanctity of human life, care for those in need,
		  justice and peace. In an increasingly secularised society interfaith dialogue
		  can help different religions to <b>stand together in proclaiming the
		  importance of faith</b>, spirituality and the transcendent aspects of
		  life. Interfaith dialogue is also important in <b>helping religions
		  support one another</b>,
		  for when the rights of one religious group are challenged all others
		  are ultimately in danger as well.
