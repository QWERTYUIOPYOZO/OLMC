		<p class="section_statement">Aboriginal spirituality as determined by the Dreaming</p>	
		<h3>Students learn to:</h3>
		<p class="section_statement">Discuss how Aboriginal spirituality is determined by the Dreaming</p>

          <li>Kinship</li>
          <li>Ceremonial life</li> 
          <li>Obligations to the land and people</li>
	    </ul>
		<ul class="summary_points">
	    <li>The Dreaming lies
		    at the heart of Aboriginal spirituality and hence is fundamental
	        to all Aboriginal cultures and societies.</li>
		<li>The Dreaming is term used
          to label all knowledge and understanding in Aboriginal societies.</li>
		<li>The
	      Dreaming is inextricably linked to the land.</li>
		<li>The Dreaming includes
	      explanations of the formation of different aspects of creation.</li>
		<li>The
		    Dreaming is communicated through art, song, dance, story, ritual
	      and kinship systems.</li>
		<li>The Dreaming is a metatemporal concept, that
		      is, it incorporates the past, present and future as a complete
		    and present reality.</li>
		</ul>			
		<h3>Kinship</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>Kinship ties identify a complex system of belonging, relationships
		    and responsibilities within a clan that are based on the Dreaming.
	      </li>
		  <li>Kinship is determined by both family relationships and a person's totem
		    and is thus a connection with the ancestor spirits, land and Dreaming. </li>
	    </ul>
		<h3>Ceremonial life </h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>Aboriginal spirituality is communicated through things
	        such as art, story, dance, ceremonies etc. </li>
		  <li>Totems link Aboriginal people
		      to a particular animal which is the representation of an ancestral
	        spirit being. </li>
		  <li>Totems carry with them ceremonial/ritual responsibilities - these
		      are most commonly called balance rites. 
            Obligations to the land and people</li>
		  <li>The Dreaming is inextricably connected
	        to the land.</li>
		  <li> The land is the physical medium through which the Dreaming
	        is lived and communicated. </li>
		  <li>The land is a resting place for ancestral
	        spirit beings. </li>
		  <li>There are ritual responsibilities connected with sacred
	        sites, which are commonly known as balance rites. </li>
		  <li>A sacred site is
	        the land upon which particular event in the Dreaming took place.</li>
		  <li> The
		      identity of an Aboriginal person is intimately connected with the
		    land.</li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Students learn about:</h3>
		<p class="section_statement">Issues for Aboriginal spirituality in relation to:</p>
		<ul class="section_statement">
		  <li>The effect of dispossession</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Students learn to: </h3>
		<p class="section_statement">Discuss the continuing effect of dispossession on Aboriginal
      spiritualities in relation to:</p>
		<ul class="section_statement">
		  <li>Separation from land</li>
          <li>Separation from kinship groups</li>
          <li>The Stolen Generation</li>
		</ul>
		<ul class="summary_points">
	      <li>The impact of dispossession has been enormous
          and overwhelmingly detrimental.</li>
	      <li>The loss of land amounts to a loss
          of identity and the burden of not being able to fulfil ritual responsibilities.</li>
	      <li>The
	      loss of land has destroyed the system of totemic responsibilities.</li>
	      <li>The
		    loss of language has made it impossible to pass on beliefs in an
	        authentic way.</li>
	      <li>The separation of families has destroyed the kinship system and
		    has led to a loss of identity.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>The impact of the Protection policies</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>Protection policies had
                    the stated aim of removing Aboriginal people from unsuitable
                    environments and placing them in the protection of the state
            by detaining them in homes or on missions or reserves. </li>
		  <li>The intent
                    of these policies was to isolate Aboriginal people from the
		    rest of the community until such time as their culture died out. </li>
		  <li>The
                    protection policies saw large number of children separated
		    from their families. Often they were relocated considerable distances
            from their traditional lands. </li>
		  <li> The breaking up of families and
		      removal from traditional lands had enormous detrimental impacts
		    on the maintenance of traditional beliefs. </li>
		  <li>Land, language, totems, kinship
		      and ceremonies were all significantly affected.</li>
	    </ul>
		<h3>The impact of the Assimilation policies </h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>Assimilation policies followed on from
      protection policies and led to further degradation of Aboriginal communities.
          </li>
		  <li>The aim of assimilation policies was to take Aboriginal people, particularly
		    those who were "half caste" and have them assimilated into the
                    white community so that their Aboriginality would be forgotten. </li>
		  <li>The policies of assimilation led to further separation of Aboriginal
		    children from families - the 'Stolen Generation'. </li>
		  <li>Many Aboriginal children were abused in their foster homes. </li>
		  <li>Assimilation
		    policies led to further social problems as Aboriginal people from "mission" environments
		    had not had the opportunity to learn any of the traditional skills
	      necessary for survival. </li>
	    </ul>
		<h3>Stolen Generation</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>The term Stolen Generation refers to the Aboriginal children
		    who were removed from their homes between 1900 and 1972 by the Government
		    and church missionaries in an attempt to assimilate these children
	      into European society. </li>
		  <li>Many Aboriginal children suffered maltreatment,
		    sexual exploitation, inhumane working conditions and degrading forms
	      of humiliation in their "adopted" homes.</li>
		  <li>The prohibition on traditional Aboriginal
		      practices meant that land, language, totems, kinship and ceremonies
	        were all detrimentally affected.</li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Students learn about:</h3>
		<p class="section_statement">Issues for Aboriginal spiritualities in relation to:</p>
		<ul class="section_statement">
		  <li>The land rights movement</li>
	    </ul>
		<h3>Students learn to:</h3>
		<p class="section_statement">Outline the importance of the following for the Land Rights movement:</p> 
        <ul class="section_statement">
          <li>Native Title</li> 
          <li>Mabo</li>
          <li>Wik</li>		  
	    </ul>
		<p class="section_statement">Analyse the importance of the Dreaming for the Land Rights movement </p>
		<h3>Importance of land rights in relation to Aboriginal spirituality </h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>Land rights are of critical importance in relation to Aboriginal spirituality,
                          because the Dreaming is inextricably connected with
		    the land. </li>
		  <li>The land is the resting place for ancestral spirit beings. </li>
		  <li>Each Aboriginal
	        is connected with the land through their totem. </li>
		  <li>Specific areas have
		      important spiritual meaning for particular groups of Aboriginal
		    people - these
	        are known as sacred sites.</li>
		  <li>There are special responsibilities attached
	        to sacred sites such as ceremonies etc.</li>
		  <li> The identity of an Aboriginal
		      person is inextricably linked to the land and hence the land is
		    like a mother for the people. </li>
	    </ul>
		<h3>Native Title</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>The beginnings of the modern land rights movement is usually
		      attributed to the Wave Hill Mob who went on strike for better conditions
          on a Northern Territory cattle station at Wave Hill. </li>
		  <li>Eventually after
            a protracted dispute the Whitlam Federal Government passed the first
	        land rights legislation in 1975.</li>
		  <li> Land rights legislation benefits
	        a very small percentage of Aboriginal people.</li>
		  <li>Native title refers to
		      communal or individual rights or interests of Aboriginal people
		    or Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters. </li>
	    </ul>
		<h3>Mabo</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>In June
		    1992 the High Court of Australia ruled in favour of an action brought
	      by Eddie Mabo on behalf of the Murray Island people.</li>
		  <li>The court ruled
		    that Australia was indeed an occupied land at the time of British
		    settlement and that the notion of terra nullius - "land
                            belonging to no one" - was false in regard to the
                            situation in Australia. </li>
		  <li>It further ruled that under certain circumstances a form of title known
		    as "Native
                            Title" existed under Australian law. </li>
		  <li>In order to claim Native Title it had to be proved that continuous links
                              with the land had been maintained since before
		    1788 and that the Native Title had not been extinguished as with freehold
		    title.</li>
		  <li>Native
      Title could only be claimed on a very small percentage of Australian land. </li>
	    </ul>
		<h3>The Wik case and the Native Title Amendment Act</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>In 1996 the High Court
		      ruled in favour of the Wik people who claimed that Leasehold Title
	        may not automatically extinguish Native Title. </li>
		  <li>The High Court ruled
		      that in certain circumstances Native Title and Leasehold Title
		    could co-exist and that in areas of dispute the interests of the Leasehold
	        Title holder would prevail.</li>
		  <li>In response to pressure from investors
		      in rural Australia the Howard Federal Government prepared legislation
	        to amend the Native Title Act and prevent any uncertainty.</li>
		  <li>The legislation
		      was called the Native Title Amendment Act and was commonly referred
	        to as the 10 Point Plan.</li>
		  <li>The main feature of the legislation was to
		        transfer from the Federal Government to the various State Governments
		        the power to upgrade the title from Leasehold Title to Freehold
		    Title thus extinguishing Native Title.</li>
