		<p>N.B. From its beginnings in 1901 to 1954 the census was taken each decade.  From 1961 onwards the census has been taken at regular five year intervals. A new census will be carried out in 2006 but the information on religious affiliation may not be tabulated and published for a couple of years.</p>		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Overview of the changing patterns of religious adherence</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>In 1947 Australia was predominantly <b>Anglo-Celtic</b>, with 88% of the population identifying itself as <b>Christian</b>, 0.5% as belonging to a religion other than Christianity, and 0.3% as non-religious. (The census states that answering the question on religious affiliation is voluntary; this accounts for the relatively large 11.1% in the "Not stated/Inadequately described" category.)</p> 

<p>Over subsequent decades <b>immigration</b> has helped to reshape the profile of Australia's religious affiliations. Following World War II came increasing migration from <b>Europe</b> which led to growing numbers of Orthodox Christians, the establishment of new Protestant groups, and growth in the number and diversity of Catholics. Jewish immigration from Europe has kept the proportion of <b>Jews</b> in Australia fairly <b>constant</b> at around 0.4%.  More recently, immigration from <b>Asia</b> and the <b>Middle
    East</b> has <b>expanded Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim
    numbers</b> considerably, and increased the ethnic diversity of existing Christian denominations.</p>

<p>Denominational switching, the rise of Pentecostalism and the New Age Movement have also contributed to the changes in religious affiliation over this time.  The most significant changes in affiliation from 1947 to 2001 are the decline in proportion of Christians (down by 20.0%) and the increase in the category of 'No Religion' (up by 15.2%).</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Decline in Anglican figures</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>The 2001 census figures record a <b>decline
		      of Christianity</b>, the largest religious grouping in Australia, <b>as
		      a percentage of the population. Anglicans</b> were the most dramatically affected Christian denomination, <b>dropping</b> from <b>39.0%</b> of the Australian population in 1947 to just <b>20.7%</b> in 2001.  Only around 5% of people identifying themselves as Anglicans are at church each week.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Numerical increase in Catholic figures</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p><b>Catholics</b> have <b>increased</b> from <b>20.9%</b> of the Australian population in 1947 to <b>remain
		      stable</b> at around <b>25-27%</b> of the population since the 1960s.  Catholicism has benefited greatly from <b>immigration</b> making it Australia's <b>largest</b> and most <b>multicultural</b> denomination.  The proportion of Catholics <b>peaked
		      in 1991 at 27.3%</b> but in <b>2001 was down to
		      26.6%</b>.  Despite the recent decline as a percentage of the population, they have <b>continued
		      to increase numerically</b> from 4,606,644 in 1991 to 5,001,624 in 2001.  However these apparently healthy figures mask the growing issue of nominal Catholics - who were baptised Catholic and still identify themselves as such - but who for various reasons do not participate in the faith life of the Catholic community.  Less than 20% of Australian Catholics attend mass each weekend. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Decline in Presbyterian and Uniting Church figures</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>The <b>Presbyterian</b> Church <b>dropped</b> from 9.8% in 1947 to 3.4% in 2001.  This is due in part to many of its members taking part in the merger between Presbyterians, Methodists and Congregationalists to form the Uniting Church in 1977. While the Methodist and Congregationalist Churches no longer exist in Australia a number of Presbyterians withdrew from the merger and continue to exist today. The <b>Uniting
		      Church</b> (formed in 1977) <b>dropped</b> from 7.6% in 1986 to 6.7% in 2001.  These churches have faced not only a <b>decrease
		      in the percentage of those adhering to that denomination as a percentage
		      of the population</b> but also a <b>decline in
		      actual numbers</b> over the past 10 years.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Numerical increase in Orthodox figures</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>In 1947 only 0.2% of the population were Orthodox Christian, but following a dramatic growth after World War II, the proportion of adherents to <b>Orthodox
		      denominations</b> has remained fairly <b>constant</b> since the 1970s at about 2.7-2.8%. In 1996 Orthodox Christians constituted 2.82% of the population; this figure has dropped slightly to 2.8% in 2001, but this actually indicates a <b>growth
		      in actual numbers</b> due to the population growth of Australia.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Steady growth in Pentecostal figures</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>The figures for <b>Pentecostals</b> record a <b>steady
		      growth</b> since they first appeared in the census in the 1960s (when it was just 0.2% of the population) both as <b>a
		      percentage of the population and in actual numbers</b>. In 1996 Pentecostals constituted 0.98% which only increased to 1.0% in 2001. This was a much lower growth than anticipated considering the growing visibility of Pentecostalism in Australia.</p>   

<p>However, in 2000 Pentecostal leaders congregated together to form the <b>Australian
    Christian Churches</b>. These leaders then encouraged their members to write in Australian Christian Churches rather than Pentecostal so the census may not reflect the actual growth of Pentecostalism.  Despite the low proportion of Pentecostals in the population, they show the greatest fidelity of any denomination in attending weekly church services, coming second only to Catholics in the numbers actually at church each week.
</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Rise of secularism</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>The rise of secularism has led to both a drop in the numbers of people regularly attending religious services should along with the <b>significant
		      increase in the "No Religion" category</b>. In 1947 only 0.3% of the population classified themselves as having "No Religion".  However, in 1971 the instruction "if no religion, write none" was introduced into the census. This saw a seven-fold increase from the previous census year in the percentage of persons stating they had no religion (0.8% in 1966 to 6.7% in 1971). Thus many people who would have previously fallen under the "Not Stated" category were now included.  Since 1971 this percentage has progressively increased to about 16.5% in 1996, with a dip to 15.5% in 2001.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Jewish figures have remained steady </p></div>
		<div class="text"><p><b>Jewish</b> figures have remained quite <b>steady</b> since the beginning of the census with the proportion of Jews in Australia fairly constant at around 0.4%.  The number of Jews migrating following the Second World War doubled the numbers of Jews in Australia, but as the general population also doubled the proportion remained the same.
It is likely, however, that the Jewish population is larger than reflected in the census. Many Jewish migrants have suffered religious persecution before coming to Australia and are wary of disclosing their religious identity for fear of further persecution.
</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Steady increase in Hindu, Muslim and Buddhist figures</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>The numbers of people who subscribe to <b>Buddhism,
		      Hinduism and Islam are steadily increasing</b> largely due to immigration. In 1947 adherents of Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam were too few in number to show up as a proportion on the census (each less than 0.1%). <b>Buddhism</b> has shown <b>rapid
		      growth</b> in recent decades, recently overtaking Islam to become
		      the largest religion other than Christianity in Australia. In 1986 Buddhists
		      comprised 0.5% of the population; by 2001 they made up 1.9%. <b>Hindus
		      increased</b> from comprising 0.1% of the Australian population in 1986 to 0.5% in 2001. The <b>numbers
		      of Muslims</b> in Australia have also <b>increased
		      dramatically</b> from just 2,704 in 1947 to 281,500 people in 2001.  Islam first showed up on the census in 1976 (0.3%) but now accounts for 1.5% of the population.</p>
