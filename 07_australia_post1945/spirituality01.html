		<h1>Content Description </h1>
		<h2>Aboriginality Spirituality Determined by the Dreaming</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p><p>Definition</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>The fundamental tenet that underpins Aboriginal spirituality is a concept known as the 
		<b>Dreaming</b>. The Dreaming is a term referring to Aboriginal spiritual beliefs about creation and existence.
		According to Aboriginal belief, all life as it is today - human, animal and plant is part of one vast unchanging
		network of relationships which can be traced to the <b>ancestral
		spirit beings</b> of the Dreaming. The Dreaming involves <b>all
		knowledge and understanding in Aboriginal societies</b>, and hence incorporates all beliefs and practices of Aboriginal
		communities.</p>
		<p>The Dreaming includes an explanation of the <b>origins
		    of the universe</b>, that is, how the world came into being as a
		result of the actions of ancestral spirit beings upon the land. These ancestral beings could be found in the form of
		animals, plants, humans or part humans.  They determined the rules by which all living creatures should live by.</p>
		<p>The Dreaming is <b>inextricably connected to the land</b>, as the land is the physical medium through which the Dreaming
		is communicated, since it is within the land that the ancestor spirits of the Dreaming continue to dwell. The Dreaming
		is a <b>metatemporal</b> concept, which means it is a concept that incorporates the past, present and future reality as a
		complete and present reality.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>The Dreaming is embedded in all aspects of life</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>The influence of the <b>Dreaming is embedded in all aspects of Aboriginal life</b>. 
		The different facets
		of Aboriginal life, from the ceremonial dimension of life, to the ritualistic obligations owed to the land and people,
		as well as the intricate kinship system are all intrinsically connected to, and are derived from the Dreaming. Thus,
		because the Dreaming is so intimately connected with every dimension of Aboriginal life, the process of telling and
		learning the stories of the Dreaming is a life long one. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2"><h3>Kinship</h3>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Kinship ties identify a complex <strong>system
		      of belonging and responsibilities within a clan</strong>. It is
		based not only on familial relations but also on relationships springing from one's <strong>totem</strong>, usually a plant or animal,
		which represents a person or group's connection to the ancestor beings within the land. Kinship ties govern the day to
		day life of the Aboriginal people by determining issues from whom an individual is permitted to talk to and marry, to
		determining what are an individual's responsibility is to other members in the clan.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Significance of Kinship ties</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Kinship ties also assign the responsibility to transmit the knowledge of the Dreaming from elders
		to the younger generation. People are initiated into the Dreaming by different degrees according to their age and
		position in the community. This process of learning the Dreaming is a life long pursuit.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		  <h3>Obligations to the land and people</h3>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Dreaming is inextricably connected to the land</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>The land is of paramount importance to Aboriginal spirituality. Aboriginal people have
		traditionally regarded the land as their mother and hence have worked to deepen their understanding and appreciation
		of the land. The Dreaming is inextricably connected to the land, as the <b>land is the physical medium through which the
		Dreaming is lived and communicated</b>. The land provides the foundation for Aboriginal beliefs, traditions, rituals and
		laws because the stories of the Dreaming are embedded in the land. Furthermore, the land acts as a <b>dwelling place for
		ancestral spirit beings</b>. Since the land is revered as a mother of the people, the <b>identity</b> of an Aboriginal person is
		inextricably <b>linked to the land</b>. At the commencement of many formal public events in Australia an <b>acknowledgement of
		the traditional owners</b> of the land indicates this significant link between the indigenous people and the areas in
		which they have lived for thousands of years.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Sacred sites</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Whilst all land is important to all Aboriginal people, particular sites, known as <b>sacred sites</b> or <b>ritual estate</b> have a special significance for particular Aboriginal groups as they are connected with particular events in the Dreaming. Aboriginal people have special <b>ritual responsibilities</b> to take care of, and to learn from these sacred sites which are off-limits and hidden from the non-initiated. For example, Aboriginal people are responsible for performing prescribed rituals such as <b>balance rites</b>, which aim for the proliferation of a particular animal, plant or natural phenomena that is connected with a particular spirit being from the Dreaming.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Ceremonial Life</h2>
		<h3>Art</h3>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Art communicates the Dreaming</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Art is a very important <b>way of communicating the Dreaming</b> because it illustrates the actions of the ancestral spirit beings in the land. However, art does not offer a simple, straightforward explanation of the Dreaming; rather art has <b>multiple levels of meaning</b>. At face value, paintings offer an aerial representation of the land and its inhabitants, using certain symbols to represent particular features of the land, plants and animals. At a deeper level, paintings offer a narrative representation of the activities of an ancestor spirit upon the land. Even more profound levels of meaning reveal the subtler aspects of the Dreaming stories; however such access to the higher levels of meaning is only known by initiates.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2"><h3>Stories</h3>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Stories from the Dreaming describe Aboriginal law and lifestyle</p> </div>
		<div class="text"><p><b>The Dreaming</b> is primarily expressed through <b>stories</b> that describe how the ancestral spirits, often in the form of animals or people, moved through the land creating rivers, lakes and mountains and other natural phenomena.  Their conflicts and other interactions provide a foundation and explanation of various aspects of Aboriginal <b>tradition</b> and <b>law</b>, by explaining the creation of the natural world and how the Dreaming shapes the day-to-day life of people and animals. Learning the stories of the Dreaming, a life long process, is an important tool for the socialization of Aboriginal children as it is a major <b>way of teaching Aboriginal children about right and wrong behaviour</b> in society.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2"><h3>Rituals</h3>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Rituals from the Dreaming relive activities of ancestor spirits</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Ceremonies and rituals, which are derived from important aspects of the Dreaming, are important because they are understood as a moment of reliving in the present moment, the creative activities of the ancestor spirits. Thus, a ceremony is not simply a retelling of the story but rather they represent the <b>reliving of the story in a powerfully sacred way</b>. The ancestral beings are made present through the people, objects, words and movements of the ritual. An example of an action used in traditional ritual is the <b>smoking ceremony</b> in which smoke is used to cleanse and heal. Smoking rituals can be used symbolically at public events but other traditional uses include the use of smoking ceremonies during pregnancies.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h3>Totems</h3>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Totems represent the individual as they existed in the Dreaming and carry ceremonial responsibilities</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p><b>Totems</b> are the <b>embodiment of each individual in his or her primordial state</b>. In other words, totems represent that person, as they existed in the Dreaming, whether it is in the form of an animal, plant or natural phenomena. They are thus links between an individual or community and particular ancestor spirits in the land.  Totems carry with them, <b>ceremonial responsibilities</b> commonly known as <b>balance rites</b>.</p>

<p>Balance rites aim to assist the proliferation of a particular species, which embody an individual's ancestral spirit being as they existed in the Dreaming. For example, suppose that in the Dreaming, people in a particular tribe were part echidna and part human. As a result, this tribe would have important ritualistic responsibilities towards echidnas, as this animal represents the embodiment of their ancestral spirit being. It must be noted however, that we should treat the Western conceptualization of totems with caution, because it is often difficult to capture and understand the multiple nuances of meaning involved in this powerfully sacred concept.</p>
