  <h2>Sample Responses</h2>
		<b>Assess the impact of separation from the land on contemporary Aboriginal spiritualities. (5 marks, 150 words)</b>
		<p>Separation from the land, also known as dispossession, has had a vast and overwhelmingly detrimental impact on contemporary Aboriginal spiritualities. Separation from the land has had the devastating effect of severing an Aboriginal person's ties with their spirituality because the Dreaming is inextricably linked to the land.  The Government policies of protection and assimilation, which separated Aboriginal people from the land, has significantly affected the maintenance of traditional beliefs regarding land, languages, totems, kinship and ceremonies. Firstly, the loss of land amounts to a loss of identity due to the existence of an ever present burden of not being able to fulfil ritual responsibilities. Secondly, the loss of land has destroyed the system of totemic responsibilities and their connections with the ancestor beings who dwell in the land. Thirdly, the removal of Aboriginal people to missions and reserves where traditional Aboriginal practices were prohibited resulted in a loss of language and tradition. This has made it almost impossible to pass on beliefs in an authentic manner. Finally, dispossession has resulted in the destruction of the kinship system. The separation from land to be placed on missions and reserves did provide some Aboriginal people with minor benefits in the areas of health care and education. On the whole however dispossession has had an overwhelmingly detrimental impact on contemporary Aboriginal spirituality.</p>
		
		<p><b>Analyse the relationship between ceremonial life and the Dreaming in contemporary Aboriginal spiritualities. (5 marks, 150 words)</b></p>
		<p>All aspects of the Aboriginal ceremonial life (including art, stories, songs, dances, rituals and totems) are derived from the Dreaming. The Dreaming is a term used to describe all knowledge and understanding in Aboriginal societies. Subsequently, the ceremonial life is a medium through which the core tenet of all Aboriginal societies, that is, the Dreaming is communicated. Art that is used in ceremonies offers a multifaceted interpretation and explanation of the Dreaming for different groups of Aboriginal people. Similarly, stories told during rituals are derived from the Dreaming. These Dreaming stories describe the process of creation, explain the foundations of various aspects of Aboriginal law and tradition. They are ways of teaching about right and wrong behaviour in society, and ultimately reinforce the importance of ceremonies to keep the Dreaming alive. In rituals the ancestor beings of the Dreaming are made present through the people and symbols involved.  Balance rites are ceremonies that aim to ensure harmony within the land and assist the proliferation of a particular animal or plant. Initiation ceremonies at particular significant stages of people's lives lead them into a deeper understanding of the Dreaming. Because of the separation of Aboriginal people from their traditional land many important ceremonies that are ties to specific sacred sites of the Dreaming can no longer be done and have been lost.</p>
		
		<p><b>Outline the history of the land rights movement and assess its importance for contemporary Aboriginal spiritualities. (5 marks, 150 words)</b></p>
		<p>The modern land rights movement began in 1966 as a result of the efforts of Vincent Lingiari, the leader of the Wave Hill Mob. After a protracted dispute, the Whitlam Government provided the first land rights legislation in 1975. In 1992, the High Court in the Mabo decision, overruled the long held fiction that Australia was terra nullius in 1788 and concluded that in certain circumstances native title exists over Australian land. This was followed by the Wik decision of 1996, which is authority for the principle that the rights of Leasehold Title holders, co-exists with the rights of Native Title holders. The land rights movement is of critical importance to the maintenance of contemporary Aboriginal spiritualities, because the Dreaming, which is the concept that lies at the heart of Aboriginal spirituality, is inextricably linked to the land. Land is essential to Aboriginal spiritualities because the land is the medium through which the Dreaming is communicated. The land is also important because it is the resting place for ancestral spirit beings. Though Native Title has provided some Aboriginal groups with economic and social independence, the effect of the land rights movement on Aboriginal spirituality has been limited. This is because native title can only be claimed on a very small percentage of Australian land; proving native title is a long, complicated and expensive legal process; and native title does not always provide access to sacred sites which may be on freehold land.</p>
