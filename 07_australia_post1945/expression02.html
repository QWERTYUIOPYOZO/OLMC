		<h1>Content Description </h1>
		<h2>Christianity as the major religious tradition</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Historical background</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>By 1947 Christianity had long been established as the major religious tradition in Australia. This was due to the <b>European
		      settlers</b> of the 18th and 19th centuries who brought to Australia their <b>traditional
		      Christian churches</b> - predominately the Church of England and the Roman Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, Lutheran and Baptist churches. Traditional Indigenous religions were not recognised or even banned and <b>missionary
		      efforts</b> were made to convert the natives. Despite sectarianism between different denominations, the tradition of <b>Christianity
		      was dominant</b> in Australia and to some extent shaped the nation's identity.  By allowing in only people from certain European countries the <b>'White Australia' Policy</b> (enshrined in the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901) effectively also <b>kept
		      out religious traditions other than Christianity</b>.  Consequently in 1947: 88.0% of Australians considered themselves Christian, 0.4% Jewish, 0.2% had no religion, and less than 0.1% acknowledged belonging to another religious tradition.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Factors contributing to the decline of Christianity </p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>The 2001 census figures reveal that Christianity is still the numerically largest religious tradition in Australia accounting for 68.0% of the population. However, there has been a <b>significant
		      decline in the percentage of people affiliated with Christianity</b>.  Furthermore, of those claiming affiliation <b>there
		      has been a decline in the regular attendance of religious services</b>. The ongoing decline in most Christian groups as a percentage of the population is due to <b>increasing
		      secularisation, dissatisfaction with traditional religious movements,
		      aging membership</b>, and a <b>lack of migrant
		      intake</b>. Of all the Christian denominations the Anglican, Uniting and Presbyterian churches have been most acutely affected by this decline in the numbers of those regularly attending church.</p>

<p>There are a number of factors that need to be considered in attempting to draw conclusions from this data. Firstly, it needs to be noted that up until recently the churches themselves collected the only detailed information available on regular church attendance. Researchers now consider these figures to be overstated. Thus the slumps in religious observance may not have decreased as drastically as some may suggest. Secondly, new and emerging forms of religious practice are often not acknowledged in statistics on church attendance. This means that the plethora of small informal groupings and individual spiritual pursuits are not acknowledged as religious practice.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Reasons for the increase in the Catholic figures</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>In contrast to the general trend of significant decreases in the number of people affiliated to Christian denominations <b>Catholicism
		      has continued to increase both numerically and proportionally</b> (from 20.9% in 1947 to 26.6% in 2001) making it the largest religious group in Australia. Catholicism has been insulated from the effect of the decline in religious affiliation because of its <b>substantial
		      migrant intake</b> and <b>slightly higher birth
		      rate</b>.  Also, people who are baptised Catholic tend to identify themselves as Catholic even if they do not practice the religion, whereas those brought up Protestant who no longer practice would more often no longer consider themselves affiliated with that denomination.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Reasons for the increase in the Pentecostal figures</p> </div>
		<div class="text"><p> The <b>Pentecostal figures</b> also display
		    a resistance to the general trend of decline in religious affiliation,
		    by <b>continuing to show an increase both numerically and as a percentage
		    of the population</b>. The <b>increase</b> in the 2001 census
		    was however <b>below expectations</b> rather than the steep increases
		    of previous years. One possible reason for this slow down is the so called <b>"revolving
		    door syndrome"</b> which recognises that large numbers of Pentecostals
		    remain with the church for a relatively short period of time, often between
		    eighteen months and two years. Another reason for the apparent slowing
		    in growth of the 2001 figures is because in 2000 Pentecostal leaders congregated
		    together to form the <b>Australian Christian Churches</b>. These
		    leaders then encouraged their members to write in Australian Christian
		    Churches rather than Pentecostal in the 2001 census.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Immigration</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Reasons for immigration following World War II</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p><b>The most significant reason for the
		      increase in the diversity of the religious character in Australia is
		      immigration</b>. The large number of immigrants since the Second World War can be attributed to various factors. Firstly, in the aftermath of the war many Europeans (and some non-European <b>refugees</b>) whose families and homes had been devastated sought to start a new life in a safer and more secure environment. Secondly, the Australian government during this time actively sought immigration in the belief the nation's security and economic prosperity was dependant upon a significant increase to its population. To achieve this, the Australian government offered <b>assisted
		      passage to migrants</b> hoping to entice them to come to Australia. Thirdly, the <b>decline
		      of the 'White Australia' policy</b> up to its final demise in 1973 meant that the migration of people from a greater variety of ethnic groups became easier. Fourthly, <b>overseas
		      wars and persecution</b> have led to waves of immigration from affected areas - e.g. Vietnam (1970s); Lebanon (1980s); Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina (1990s).</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Immigration has changed Australia into a multifaith society</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Immigration has greatly increased the number of people affiliated
            with religious traditions other than Christianity. Two-thirds of
            Australia's
            Muslim community were born overseas, coming from over 70 different
            countries. The main sources of Islamic immigration are the <b>Middle
            East</b> (particularly Lebanon, Iraq and Iran), <b>Europe</b> (
            Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina) and <b>Asia</b> ( Malaysia
          and Indonesia).</p>
          <p>The growth of <b>Buddhism </b>is the result of immigration
            from troubled areas of the <b>Indo-Chinese</b><b> Peninsula</b> -
            that is from Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. In recent years, Buddhist
            figures have further increased as a result of immigration from Malaysia,
            Thailand, Hong Kong and China. Significant numbers of <b>Jews </b>have
            also migrated from a variety of <b>European </b>origins. <b>Hindu</b> figures
            in Australia have also been increased as a result of immigration
            from <b>India</b> and <b>Fiji</b>. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Impact of immigration on Christian membership in Australia</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> As a result of immigration there has been a significant
		    change to the previously predominantly Anglo-Celtic membership of
		    the Christian tradition. Many migrants from <b>Eastern Europe</b> have
		    brought their <b>Orthodox </b> denomination of Christianity to
		    Australia and this is particularly evident in Sydney and Melbourne. The
		    increase in the number of <b>Catholics</b> in Australia in the
		    post World War Two period is largely the result of immigration from <b>Mediterranean
		    countries</b> (especially Italy and Malta) as well as some from <b>Eastern
		    Europe</b> ( Poland and the Ukraine). More recently, Roman Catholic
		    figures have increased as a result of immigration from <b>Asia</b> (
		    Vietnam and the Philippines), <b>Latin America</b> and <b>Africa</b>.
		    In addition to the Roman Catholic population, <b>Eastern Catholics </b>(Maronite,
		    Melkite and Ukrainian rite Catholics) have also immigrated. There
		    is a significant population of Maronite Catholics who have mostly come
		    from Lebanon in the <b>Middle East</b>. These successive waves
		    of immigration have significantly altered the ethnic mix of Catholicism - from
		    being predominantly Irish to becoming the most multicultural of faiths
		    in Australia - while at the same time contributing to its growth
	      in comparison to other Christian denominations such as the Anglicanism.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2"><h2>Denominational switching</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Reasons for denominational switching</p> </div>
		<div class="text"><p><b>Denominational switching</b> refers to the <b>transfer
		      of followers from one Christian denomination to another</b>. This phenomenon is far <b>more
		      common in Protestant denominations</b> than in Catholic or Orthodox groups. Catholic and Orthodox Christians tend to have a higher level of denominational loyalty based on their appreciation of their own distinctive histories, traditions and liturgies.</p>

<p>Protestants, especially younger ones, will more often 'shop around' for a new denomination based on factors such as liking the minister, style of worship and music, proximity to home, sense of community and activities (such as prayer groups, Bible studies and youth groups) provided by a particular congregation. People no longer remain in a particular denomination simply because their parents and grand-parents belonged to it or because they share the same ethnic background with other church members.</p>

<p>In contemporary society loyalty to a particular community has to be earned. With the contemporary ethos of individualism people focus on their personal needs rather than the needs of their traditional communities.  People are looking around for the 'right' congregation in which to get involved - one that meets their needs, expresses their faith in culturally appropriate ways and addresses their concerns in meaningful ways.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Characteristics of Pentecostalism</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The ongoing growth of Pentecostalism is largely based on denominational
		  switching from other non-Pentecostal Protestant churches. <b>Pentecostalism
		  is an evangelical and charismatic strand of the Christian tradition. </b> Evangelical
		  Christians place great emphasis on personal conversion, a fundamentalist/literal
		  approach to the Bible and downplays the importance of liturgy and ritual,
		  focusing rather on dynamic preaching of the scripture. Charismatic
		  Christians place a strong emphasis on the gifts of the Holy Spirit
		  such as 'speaking
		  in tongues', prophecy and faith healing. The 1996 census reported a <b>massive
		  increase of 60% in the Pentecostal figures</b> over the past 10 years.
		  This is partly due to the fact that Pentecostal groups attract many
		  people who have been disaffected by other Christian communities.
		  </p>
		  <p> Pentecostalism is well known for its emphasis on <b>music </b> (e.g.
  Hillsong), especially contemporary music with sophisticated production and
  presentation. This is particularly appealing to the younger generation who
  often express dissatisfaction with the staid nature of worship in traditional
  churches. Many people also chose to join Pentecostal denominations because
  of the <b>strong sense of community</b> and <b>charismatic leaders</b>.</p>
<p> However, research indicates that many people leave Pentecostalism after about
  two years - indicating that for many it is exciting and involving in the short
  term but unfulfilling in the long run. This phenomenon is known as the '<b>revolving
  door syndrome'</b>.</p>
Historically , Pentecostalism has seen increases in membership during times of
uncertainty and anxiety. Many believe that the economic uncertainty and pessimism,
which has characterised much of the past two decades, has contributed greatly
to the attraction of a religious way of life, which offers clear cut and definite
answers to complex and often troubling circumstances.

		<div class="content2"><h2>Rise of New age religions</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>It is difficult to define precisely what a <b>new
		      age religion</b> is, because new age religions are extremely diverse in nature. The term "new age" should be understood as a kind of <b>umbrella
		      term to cover a range of spiritual beliefs and practices</b> aiming to foster <b>individual
		      fulfilment</b> in the form of <b>personal happiness,
		      health and meaning in life</b>. New age religions can be followed as an <b>alternative
		      to, or in conjunction with</b>, other more <b>traditional
		      religious practices</b>.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Characteristics of new age religion</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Despite the diversity there are some characteristics that are common
		  across many new age religions. New age religions tend to be <b>individualistic</b> and <b>search
		  oriented</b> rather than focused on an established tradition that has
		  an established community, official doctrine and structures of authority.</p>
		  <p> They often involve a focus upon the development of the <b>self</b> and
  the exploration of <b>individual</b> spirituality, and the notion
  that the divine exists within each person. <b>Mystical experiences</b> or
  higher states of consciousness are often important. New age religions often <b>seek
  wisdom in ancient and Eastern traditions</b>, such as Buddhism, Hinduism
  and Sufism, but only accept the teachings that suit them rather than the whole
  integrated worldview.</p>
<p> Many new age religions are attracted by <b>indigenous spirituality</b> and
  may chose to pick out elements of the belief systems of indigenous religions
  including Celtic, Native American, African and Australian Aboriginal. Consequently,
  new age religions generally favour a <b>creation centred spirituality</b> - the
  belief that the transcendent is found through the natural world.</p>
Many followers of new age religions would <b>reject</b><b> monotheism</b>,
the belief in a single transcendent God, but might accept a <b>Goddess</b> (often
called "<em>Gaia</em>" or the "Earth Mother"), many gods
(<b>polytheism</b>), worship of nature (<b>pantheism</b>)
and/or the belief that everything is one (<b>monism</b>). These inclinations
suggest a <b>rejection of traditional Western Christianity </b> which
is blamed for many of the current world problems.
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Reasons for the popularity of new age religion</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The popularity of new age religions can be attributed to various factors.
		  One significant reason for their popularity is that new age religions
		    are <b>individualistic
		  and liberal</b> in the sense that it is the type of spirituality in
		  which a person can pick and choose which beliefs and practices to follow
		  and hence tailor a 'religion' to suit their individual preferences.
		  </p>
		  <p> Many people supplement traditional religion with aspects of new age spiritualities.
  It is not uncommon for a person practising a traditional religion such as Christianity
  or Islam to also take up a practice associated with new age spiritualities
  such as feng shui or numerology.</p>
<p> Another significant reason why new age religions are increasingly popular
  is because despite <b>general dissatisfaction at mainstream religions</b> there
  is still a <b>longing for a spiritual dimension to life</b>. It can
  be said that the new age movement developed as a reaction against what some
  perceived as the failure of Christianity and the failure of secular humanism
  to provide spiritual and ethical guidance in the contemporary world.</p>
<p> The idea of straying away from one's own cultural and spiritual traditions
  to find personal fulfilment and discover one's own spirituality can be
  traced back to the social revolution which took place in the 1960s. A critical
  part of this <b>reaction against traditional Western Christianity</b>,
  which many saw as rigid and staid, is a shift away from external means of salvation
  and a re-emphasis on <b>creation centred spirituality</b>, which
  uses nature mysticism to promote personal, social and ecological harmony.</p>
A final reason as to why some new age religions are so popular is some of their
practices claim to be a supernatural means of <b>curing sickness, predicting
the future, or gaining personal wealth</b>.

		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Various forms of new age religion</p> </div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> <b>New age religions come in many forms</b>. Some new age
		    religions include beliefs about the power of certain physical designs
		    and objects. Other new age movements centre on animals or other parts
		    of creation as being the key to harmony and wellbeing. Examples of new
		    age spiritualities include:
		  </p>
		  <ol>
		    <li>
		      <p><b> Numerology</b>, which is belief that certain numbers
                and patterns of numbers hold the key to understanding human existence. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p><b> Astrology</b>, which is based on the principal
                      that the reading of the stars in conjunction with the time
		        of birth to predict a person's individual traits and anticipate
		        the future course of their lives. The instrument used to determine
                      these predictions is called a horoscope. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p><b> Yoga and tai chi</b>,  which are used by people
                  as forms of gentle exercise, meditation and relaxation. It
		      is believed that such use of yoga and tai chi will lead to a healthier
		      more peaceful life. Yoga and tai chi however, in their pure forms are
                  part of the Hindu and Tao religions; many people however practice
                  them without reference to their broader religious context. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p><b> Feng shui</b>, which is the belief that the strategic
                  placement of furniture and possessions can lead to greater
		      harmony and well being in life. It originated in Taoism. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p><b> Transcendental meditation</b> is a technique of
                  mediation that is believed to enable a person to move beyond
		      or transcend their present existence to make contact with another
                plane of existence. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p><b>Paganism</b>,  which is a collection
                    of diverse contemporary spiritualities rooted in ancient
		      indigenous traditions, deriving inspiration from them, drawing upon their
                    myths and symbols and often invoking their many gods. It
		      is characterised by a belief in the interconnection of all life, personal
		      autonomy, and immanent divinities. It is nature-centred and supportive
                  of gender equity. <b>Wicca</b>, or Witchcraft,
                is a type of paganism that practices magick as a tool for personal
                and global transformation. </p>

		<div class="content2"><h2>Secularism</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Secularism is the belief that <b>religion should not interfere with
		      or be integrated into the public affairs of a society</b>. Philosophically
		      secularism refers to the belief that human ethics and the universe should
		      be understood without reference to religion or the supernatural. Politically
		      secularism refers to the belief that religion should not interfere with
		      the political running of the state. Thus, secularism promotes the idea
	      that society would be better off by not being controlled by religion.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Reasons for secularisation</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> <b>Secularisation</b> is the process of a society becoming
	 	    more secular, i.e. less religious. Secularisation can be seen in
		    the <b>diminishing
	 	    relevance of religious values</b> for the integration and legitimation
	 	    of everyday life in society. The declines in religious affiliation,
	 	    church attendance, prayer, numbers of clergy and religious orders
	 	    are all signs of secularisation.</p>
	 	  <p>Reasons for secularisation include: increasing <b>pluralism</b> (diversity
	 	      of beliefs and cultures) in Australia means that no single religious
	 	    belief system is dominant; increasing <b>individualism</b> means
	 	    that people do not look to traditional communities for meaning in their
	 	    lives; increasing <b>materialism</b> means that spirituality
	 	    is often ignored in favour of possessions, power, looks and fame; increasing <b>disillusionment
	 	      with traditional religions</b> for hypocrisy, abuse of power and/or
	 	      irrelevance means that religions have lost moral authority and
	 	      respect; and increasing <b>scepticism towards the supernatural</b> due
	 	      to scientific progress that means that there are more atheists
	 	      and agnostics in society. Secularisation of society indicates that more
	 	      and more people are comfortable to live their lives without reference
	 	      to religion or God. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Significant increase in the number of people writing "No religion"</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>  The most telling evidence of this trend of secularisation is the significant
  increase in the number of people responding "No Religion" in the
  census. In 1947 there were only 0.3% of the population that stated they followed "No
  Religion". This <b>increased significantly</b> to 16.1% in
  1996, but has <b>dropped slightly</b> to 15.5% in 2001.</p>
	 	  The increase in "No Religion" is particularly pronounced in
	 	  the younger age categories. The increases in the number of people responded "No
	 	  Religion" should be read along with the decreasing proportions of
	 	  Australians claiming religious affiliation and the decline in church attendance.
	 	  What these figures reveal is that it has become increasing acceptable in
	 	  contemporary Australian society to have no religious affiliation or to not
	 	  participate in one's nominal religion. </div>
