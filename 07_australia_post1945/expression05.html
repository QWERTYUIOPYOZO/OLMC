		<h1>Content Description </h1>
		<div class="content2"><p>In recent decades different religious traditions in Australia have had a growing appreciation of Aboriginal spirituality and have become involved in supporting the movement for reconciliation.</p>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Historical role of Christian groups in the reconciliation process</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> A wide variety of <b>Christian groups are a part of the reconciliation </b>movement
		  and in support of issues such as <b>land rights, native title</b> and
		  a <b>formal apology to the Stolen Generation</b>. In fact many
		  Christian denominations have designated committees to ensure that they
		  maintain a close working relationship with Aboriginal people.
		  </p>
		  <p> Historically <b>Christian groups were one of the first advocates of
    Aboriginal rights</b>. In 1967 the Catholic Church and representatives
    of the Australian Council of Churches were among the most prominent leaders
    of the campaign for the referendum to grant <b>Aboriginal Australians
    citizenship</b>.</p>
In 1975 various church groups supported and applauded the passing of the first <b>land
rights legislation</b> by the Whitlam Government. In 1992 the Mabo decision
was publicly welcomed by many church groups. When conservative political factions
and various media groups began a fear campaign, churches made strong statements
affirming that the <b>Mabo</b> decision was just. Similarly in 1998,
in spite of opposition from various political groups, farmers and miners, churches
adamantly opposed the <b>Ten Point Plan</b>, which they saw as a severe
and unjust reduction on the rights of Aboriginal people to make native title
claims. </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>ANTaR</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> During this time ANTaR, which stands for <b>Australians
		      for Native Title and Reconciliation</b>, was formed. This church
		      supported community based organisation is one of the most prominent community
		      groups advocating indigenous rights and organised the Sea of Hands display
		      promoting reconciliation and justice. Phil Glendenning, the director
		      of the Christian Brother's Edmund Rice Centre for Justice and Community
		      Education, is also the national president of ANTaR. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Formal apology to Stolen Generation</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Whilst the campaign for native title and land rights
		    is a central platform for church groups advocating Aboriginal rights,
		    church groups are also involved in a range of issues to assist the ongoing
		    process of reconciliation. For example, in 1997 following the publication
		    of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission's (HREOC)
		    report <em>Bringing
		    Them Home</em> church groups offered <b>formal apologies</b> regarding
		    the <b>role of missionaries in the abuse of Aboriginal people</b>.
		    They also strongly urged the Government to make a public apology
		    for their role in implementing the protection and assimilation policies,
	      and to implement the recommendations made by HREOC.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Interfaith support for reconciliation</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> Reconciliation is an issue for which there is <b>interfaith
		      support </b>from different religious traditions. <b>Jewish</b> groups
		      for example hold a week of prayer for reconciliation every year. In 1998
		      the Australian and New Zealand Union for Progressive Judaism voiced their
		      support for the Wik decision and opposed the Ten Point Plan.</p>
		  <p> In 2000 the Executive Council of the Australian Jewry also urged the
		    Australian Government to implement the recommendations made by the <em>National
		    Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children
		    and Their Families</em>.</p>
		  The Australian Federation of <b>Islamic </b>Councils and the <b>Buddhist</b> Peace
		  Fellowship have also made statements in support of indigenous rights
		  and reconciliation.</div>
