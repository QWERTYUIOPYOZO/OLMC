		<h1>Content Description </h1>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p><b> Ecumenism</b> refers to the <b>movement
		      towards religious unity amongst Christian denominations</b>. Unity
		      does not mean uniformity. It is not about combining all denominations
		      into one, but rather an acknowledgement that their <b>unity in Christ</b> outweighs
		      their <b>diversity in practice and beliefs</b>. In contrast
		      to the historical conflict between Christian denominations, ecumenism
		      is leading them to work, worship and dialogue together.</p>
		  <p> Ecumenism began as a <b>grass roots movement</b>, driven largely
		    by the experiences of individual believers who recognised that what Christians
		    have in common is more significant than the things that divide them. The
		    leadership of various denominations have also come to recognise the '<b>scandal
		    of Christian disunity</b>' - that while Christians are
		    divided among themselves they fail to be effective witnesses of Christ's
		    message of love to the world.</p>
		  Ecumenism is the opposite of <b>sectarianism</b>, which refers
		  to division and conflict between groups within the same religion. The ecumenical
		  progress in Australia is even more remarkable in light of the sectarian history
		  of Christianity both here and overseas. </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Nature of ecumenical initiatives </p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> There are various levels of ecumenical developments.
		    At the highest level there are <b>joint commissions:</b> formal
		    ecumenical bodies that work to find official agreement on issues that have
		    often divided denominations. For example the Anglican Roman Catholic International
		    Commission (ARCIC) has held discussions on Baptism, Eucharist, Ministry,
		    Authority and Mary. The Lutheran and Roman Catholic churches have signed
		    a <em>Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification</em> (1998), now
		    finding theological agreement on 'faith and works, which was one
		    of the key reasons for the Reformation split between the two.</p>
		  <p> On a <b>practical level:</b> various Christian denominations
		    cooperate on social justice issues and during times of crisis. Examples
		    of this action based ecumenical approach include the welfare agency Christian
		    World Services, the Palm Sunday Peace March, the Drop the Debt campaign,
		    and the response to the Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004.</p>
		  At a <b>local parish level:</b> various grass roots initiatives
		  have been undertaken to implement ecumenism within the community, such as
		  having inter-denominational prayer services and dialogues. On an <b>educational
		  level</b><b>:</b> there are initiatives such as the <b>Sydney
		  College of Divinity</b>, which is an ecumenical federation of theological
		  colleges working together to provide education in theology and ministry. </div>
		</div>

		<div class="footnote"><p>Uniting Church</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> A great success of the ecumenical movement in Australia
		    is the formation of the <b>Uniting</b><b> Church</b>.
		    The Uniting Church is the 3 rd largest Christian denomination in Australia
		    and is the only notable religious denomination of Australian origin. It
		    was founded in <b>1977</b> through a merger of all <b>Methodists</b>,
		    65% of <b>Presbyterians</b> and 95% of <b>Congregationalists</b>.
		    The <em>Basis of Union</em>, the foundational document for the Uniting
		    Church, states that the reason for this merger is their "seeking
		    to bear witness to that <b>unity which is both Christ's gift and will
		    for the Church</b>." T he Uniting Church is thus notable for
		    the fact that it has ecumenism as one of its primary aims. The name "Uniting" was
		    specifically chosen (rather than "United") to indicate this
		    ongoing commitment to promote ecumenism among the churches of Australia. </p>

		<div class="content2"><h3>National Council of Churches in Australia - <a href="http://www.ncca.org.au/home_page" target="_blank">www.ncca.org.au/home_page</a></h3>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Ecumenical initiatives undertaken by NCCA</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The <b>National Council of Churches in Australia</b> (NCCA)
		    is an <b>ecumenical body</b> that aims to deepen the relationship
		  of member churches "in order to express more visibly the unity willed
		  by Christ" and strengthen the cause of <b>Christian unity in Australia</b> by
		  leading different denominations to <b>work, pray and grow together</b>.
		  </p>
		  <p> It comprises of 15 member Christian churches that dialogue and collaborate
  in a range of ways. For example , the NCCA has an aid and development agency
  called the <b>Christian World Service</b> that works to develop a
  better future for people suffering from injustice and poverty. Aid and development
  is delivered through overseas ecumenical partners in Africa, Asia, Middle East
  and the Pacific.</p>
In Australia, the Christian World Service supports refugees and displaced people
through advocacy, education and the work of ecumenical state council networks.
The NCCA also provides resources for the annual <b>Week of Prayer for Christian
Unity</b>, supports the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander
Ecumenical Commission, has a Youth Network, a Social Justice Network, and a Gender
Commission to promote inclusivity within member churches. </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Historical development of NCCA</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The ecumenical movement in Australia was <b>initially an Anglican
		      and Protestant</b> affair with the <b>Australian Council of
		      Churches</b> formed
		  after World War II. <b>Eastern and Oriental Orthodox</b> churches
		  joined during the 1960s and 70s. For Catholics, the 2nd Vatican Council
		  opened up fresh possibilities for relationships with other churches.</p>
		  <p>The
		    existing structure of the Australian Council of Churches was found
		    to be unsuitable to include the Catholic Church because its sheer size
		    would have overwhelmed the other churches which had smaller memberships.
		    Thus , in 1994 it was decided to disband the Australian Council of Churches
		    and form a new organization called the National Council of Churches in
		    Australia. The NCCA works in collaboration with state ecumenical councils
		    around Australia and is an associate council of the World Council of Churches </p>

		<div class="footnote"><p>Ecumenical initiatives undertaken by the NSW Ecumenical Council</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> The <b>NSW Ecumenical Council</b>, which was
		    formed in 1982, consists of 16 churches throughout NSW and the Australian
		    Capital Territory. The NSW Ecumenical Council is one of seven state/territory
		    ecumenical councils in Australia, and all of which are affiliated to the
		    National Council of Churches. In the 1990s the NSW Ecumenical Council expanded
		    to accommodate the 11 dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church in NSW and
		    the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
		  The NSW Ecumenical Council seeks to promote ecumenism through four
		  major types of initiatives. Firstly, it seeks to allow the different churches
		  to <b>reflect upon theology</b> in a united way. Secondly, it seeks
		  to provide <b>local initiatives</b> which promote ecumenism on
		  a grass roots level. Thirdly, it seeks to unite the different denominations
		  by providing a platform for different churches to address <b>social
		  justice issues</b>, for example by setting up the House of Welcome to
		  assist refugees. Finally, it recognises that in order to maintain a constant
		  spirit of ecumenism especially through to the next generation, <b>educational
		  initiatives</b> need to be undertaken to advocate ecumenism.
