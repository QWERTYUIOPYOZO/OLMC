		<h2>Sample Responses </h2>
	      <p><b> Account for the popularity of New Age religions in Australia.
          (5 marks, 150 words)</b></p>
          <p> New age religions which refer to a range of alternative spiritualities
            that aim to foster personal happiness, health and meaning in life.
            Examples of new age religions include feng shui, tarot cards, numerology,
            astrology and transcendental meditation. There are various reasons
            as to why they are so popular. The first and main reason for their
            popularity is because there is a general dissatisfaction with mainstream
            religions along with a growing longing for a spiritual dimension
            to life. For example, what makes new age religions attractive to
            many is its emphasis on creation centred spirituality, which is seen
            as diametrically opposed to the idea of external means of salvation
            as taught by the Western Church. Another significant reason for its
            popularity is the fact that new age religions are liberal in nature.
            That is, the very nature of new age religions makes it open to people
            picking and choosing particular aspects they want to incorporate
            to their personal philosophy. Another reason for their popularity
            is because some new age practices attest to being a supernatural
            means to gain personal wealth, be miraculously healed or know the
            future.</p>
          <p><b> The graph shows the percentage of Australians who have
              identified with religions other than Christianity. Account for
              the trends shown in the graph. (5 marks, 150 words)</b></p>
          <p> On the whole, there has been a steady increase in the number of
            Australians who have identified with religions other than Christianity.
            The number of people following religions other than Christianity
            significantly increased in the 1970s. The significant increases in
            the number of people professing to follow religions other than Christianity
            from 1970 onwards can be attributed to the waves of immigration that
            came following the demise of the 'White Australia' Policy
            in 1973. The effect of the end of this policy was an increase in
            the diversity of the religious character in Australia because the
            demise facilitated the immigration of people from non-Anglo-Celtic
            backgrounds. For example, immigration from the Middle East and Asia
            has increased the number of Muslims in Australia. For instance, the
            Lebanese civil war, conflict in Afghanistan and Bosnia have all led
            to increased Muslim immigration from these places. Immigration from
            Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Hong Kong and China have increased the proportion
            of Buddhists in Australia. For example, following the Vietnam War
            in the 1960-70s came increased Buddhist immigration from that area.
            Buddhism has also increased due to conversion of non-Buddhists in
            Australia. The figures for Hinduism have been increased as a result
            of immigration from India and Fiji.</p>
          <p><b> Explain the factors that have led to the growth in Pentecostalism
              in Australia. (5 marks, 150 words)</b></p>
          <p> Pentecostalism is a charismatic and evangelical strand of Christianity
            that has shown rapid growth over the last few decades. This can be
            attributed to various factors. One reason for its popularity is the
            feeling that traditional Christian denomination are out of touch
            with modern society with staid worship and irrelevant preaching.
            Pentecostalism's slick use of contemporary music and lively
            worship is often attractive to younger people. A second reason for
            their growth is that Pentecostal groups provide a strong sense of
            community and spiritual support. They often are based around a charismatic
            leader who is a dynamic and relevant communicator. A third reason
            for the popularity of Pentecostalism is because it provides definitive,
            clear cut answers to complex difficulties faced by contemporary society.
            Pentecostalism has also grown because it provides worshippers with
            spiritual experiences in the form of 'praying in tongues' and
            prophecy. Finally, Pentecostalism is increasingly popular as it often
            promises miraculous healings and prosperity to people who have faith.</p>
          <p><b> Identify two examples of ecumenical developments in Australia
              since 1945. (5 marks, 150 words)</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p> The formation of the Uniting Church. The Uniting Church was
                  formed through a merger of the Presbyterian, Methodist and
              Congregational churches in 1977 as they realised what they had
              in common outweighed the things that kept them separated. The Uniting
              Church continues to have ecumenism as one of its key goals and
            is involved with ecumenical activities such as the NCCA. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The formation
                of the National Council of Churches in Australia (NCCA). The
                NCCA's
                membership consists of 15 Christian denominations in Australia.
                The NCCA developed out of the Australian Council of Churches,
                which began after World War II involving Anglicans and Protestants.
                Orthodox churches joined in the 1980s. It finally disbanded to
                become the NCCA in 1994, now incorporating the Roman Catholic
                Church as well. It promotes shared worship, work and dialogue
                between different Christian denominations.</p>
