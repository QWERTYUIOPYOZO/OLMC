	      the present using census data</p>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li> There have been significant declines in the number of Christians
                  regularly attending religious services. </li>
          <li> This decline is most evident in the Anglican Church, the Presbyterian
                  Church and the Uniting Church. </li>
          <li> The drop in the figures for these three denominations represents
                    both a decrease in the percentage of those who are affiliated
		        with that denomination as well as a decline in actual numbers over
            the last decade. </li>
          <li> The proportion of Orthodox Christians in Australia grew rapidly
                    after the Second World War and has remained quite constant
            over the past decade. </li>
          <li> Roman Catholics have continued to increase both numerically and
                    as a percentage of the population, and have overtaken Anglicans
	          as the largest denomination in Australia. </li>
          <li> Pentecostal figures have demonstrated strong growth both numerically
                  and as a percentage of the population since the 1960s. </li>
          <li> In the last ten years however, this steep ascent appears to have
                  slowed down and reached a plateau. </li>
          <li> The significant drop in the numbers of people regularly attending
                religious services should be read in conjunction with the substantial
                trend in the increasing numbers of people writing "No Religion" or "Religion
              Not Stated" in the census. </li>
          <li> The figure for religions other than Christianity, on the whole,
                  appears to be steadily increasing from a fairly small base. </li>
          <li> Buddhist figures have grown at a steady rate from 1972 onwards
                    and is now the largest religion other than Christianity in
            Australia. </li>
          <li> Hinduism has maintained steady growth. </li>
          <li> The numbers of Muslims in Australia have also increased dramatically
                  since 1945. </li>
          <li>In 2001 the proportion of Jews was similar to that recorded
                    in 1947.</li>

		<ul class="section_statement">
          <li>Christianity as a major religious tradition</li>

           <li>Denominational switching</li>
           <li>Rise of New Age religions</li>
          <li>Secularism</li>
	    </ul>
		<h3>Christianity as the major religious tradition</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li> The significant decline in the number of Christians regularly
            attending religious services, especially in the Anglican, Uniting
            Church and Presbyterian denominations, can be attributed to the aging
            population, the lack of migrant intake and the general dissatisfaction
            impacting on other mainstream Christian groups. </li>
          <li> Roman Catholics are continuing to increase numerically, though
            not at the rate of the population because of its younger membership
            and substantial migrant intake. </li>
          <li> The significant increases in the Pentecostal figures can be attributed
            to factors such as the lively nature of its worship, its emphasis
            on contemporary music, the strong sense of community and spiritual
            support it provides, the charismatic leaders which lead the congregation
            and the clear cut answers it provides for times of uncertainty. </li>
          <li> Pentecostalism is an evangelical (fundamentalist and focused on
            conversion) and charismatic (a strong emphasis on the gifts of the
          Holy Spirit) strand of the Christian religion. </li>
		  <li>The slow down in the
            increase of Pentecostal figures in the last 10 years can be attributed
            to the 'revolving door syndrome' which recognises
		that large numbers of Pentecostals remain with the Church for a relatively
		short period of time and because many Pentecostals were encouraged by
            their leaders to write "Australian Christian Church" rather
            than "Pentecostal" on
		the 2001 census.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Immigration</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li> Changed Australia from being mono-cultural, mono-faith to multi-cultural,
            multi-faith. </li>
          <li> Since World War 2 and the lifting of the White Australia policy
            there has been much more diversity in migration and an accompanying
            increase in the diversity of religious groupings. </li>
          <li> Migration after World War 2 led to increased number of Catholics
            from countries such as Italy, Malta etc. </li>
          <li> This also increased numbers of Orthodox Christians from Greece
            and Eastern Europe. </li>
          <li> After the ending of the White Australian policy in 1972 migration
            developed from a larger range of countries bringing a wider range
            of religions. </li>
          <li> Migration has led to significant increases in the numbers of people
            who are Buddhist, Muslims, Hindus and Jews. </li>
          <li> Buddhists came from Indo-Chinese countries - Vietnam, Laos,
            Cambodia - and in more recent times Malaysia, Hong Kong and
            China. </li>
          <li> Muslims came from countries such as Indonesia, Lebanon, Iran and
            Iraq, Bosnia. </li>
          <li> Increases have also occurred in Christian denominations where
            there is a large non-Anglo population - Orthodox (Eastern Europe)
            and Catholic churches (from predominantly Irish to include Mediterranean,
          Eastern European, Asian, South American, African members). </li>
		  <li>Increased
              presence of a variety of religious groups has also led to a greater
		  appreciation of this diversity.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Denominational switching</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li> The vast majority of people affiliated with religious groups in
            Australia were born into that religion. </li>
          <li> The phenomena of swapping between denominations or groups of the
            same religious tradition is known as denominational switching. </li>
          <li> Denominational switching is more common in Protestant Churches
            than in the Catholic Church. </li>
          <li> The majority of Pentecostals have moved from another Protestant
            denomination to join the Pentecostal group. </li>
          <li> Pentecostal is the term used to describe Christian denominations
            which have a strong emphasis on the gifts of the Holy Spirit (speaking
            in tongues, healing, prophecy etc). </li>
          <li> They are often relatively small groups which provides for more
            personal interaction, they also have lively worship. </li>
          <li> Pentecostalism is the fastest growing Christian group. </li>
		  <li>Most Pentecostals
            have switched to the group from another Christian denomination. Many
            leave again after about 2 years - this is known as the 'revolving
		door syndrome'.</li>
	    </ul>
		<h3>Rise of New Age religions</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li> Census figures show a considerable level of dissatisfaction with
            traditional religious groups. </li>
          <li> Alongside this dissatisfaction is an indication of a strong and
            growing longing for a spiritual dimension to life. </li>
          <li> "New Age" is an umbrella term which refers to a range
            of alternative and/or pseudo-religious groups that people are attracted
            to. </li>
          <li> New Age religions are characterised by their adoption of elements
            of Eastern religions and their subsequent rejection of traditional
            Western views, and the fact that it favours creation centred spirituality. </li>
          <li> Some examples of new age religions are feng shui, yoga, tai chi,
            astrology, tarot cards, numerology etc. </li>
	      <li>Many people uphold traditional
              religious beliefs and practices but supplement them with new age
              elements.</li>
	    </ul>
		<h3>Secularism</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li> Secularism is the belief that religion should not interfere with
            or be integrated into the public affairs of a society. </li>
          <li> There are multiple factors which have contributed to the decline
            of religion's relevance for the integration and legitimation
            of modern life. </li>
          <li> The increasing pluralism and materialism of society alongside
            society's increasing individualism and dissatisfaction with
            traditional religions are major reasons for secularisation. </li>
	      <li>This
            trend is most evident in the significant increase in the number of
            people responding "No religion" in the census alongside
            an overall decline in the Christian figures recorded in the census.</li>

	      <li> Interfaith dialogue is a movement aimed towards

	      <li>In
	            the current political environment the need for religious leaders
		      around the world to express the commonalities which bind the religious
		      world views have become even more important in light of these cultural
	        and political divisions. </li>
	      <li> The dignity of the human person and the

		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Many
                  Christian groups strongly support reconciliation, and the issues.
                  associated with it such as land rights, native title and the
              need for a formal apology to the Stolen Generation. </li>
          <li> Historically, Christian groups have been intimately involved
		          with the process of reconciliation for example by advocating
		        Aboriginal land rights and citizenship, supporting the Mabo and
	          Wik decisions and opposing the Ten Point Plan. </li>
          <li>Australians for
                  Native Title and Reconciliation (ANTaR) is an example of a prominent
                church based organisation advocating indigenous rights. </li>
          <li> There is interfaith support for the process of reconciliation. </li>
          <li>Various
		          Jewish groups also opposed the Ten Point Plan and every year they hold
              a week of prayer for reconciliation. </li>
          <li> Islamic and Buddhist groups have also made public statements
                  supporting reconciliation, and issues such as native title, a formal
              apology to the Stolen Generation and land rights. </li>
          <li>The support that traditions
                  other than Christianity lend to reconciliation is less noticeable
                  compared to the work of Christian groups because of their smaller
                affiliation.</li>
