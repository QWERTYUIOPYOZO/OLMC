		<h2>The relationship between the religion and its society</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>Stratified societies</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>Though social organisation varied, Polynesian societies were always <strong>stratified to greater or lesser degrees</strong>, usually with a chiefly <strong>ruling class</strong> known as ali'i or arii or ariki, <strong>commoners, and a lower or slave class</strong>. Though heredity was the most important element in determining social status there was also provision for a person of ability to rise into acceptance into the aristocracy.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Priestly class</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>Originally the head of a family <strong>mediated with the divine realm</strong>, but this function became more specialised. As a result a more particular <strong>priestly class developed</strong>. These were known as Kahuna or tahu'a or tohunga or tufuga. These priests were regarded as <strong>experts in spiritual matters</strong> and in <strong>possession of higher knowledge</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Social structure ethical standards and taboos</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>There is much variation in the region as to how much the roles of chief and priest were separate or combined, and to what degree they related to civil power.</p>
		    <p>The relationship between the religion and its society can be seen in three areas. These are the <strong>social structure</strong> aligned with beliefs in descendents of ancestor heroes, <strong>ethical standards</strong> aligned with the legendary actions of these heroes and <strong>taboos</strong> aligned with elements of mythical stories.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Social structure</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The alignment between a stratified social structure and the belief in the <strong>ancestry of hero figures</strong> is very evident in traditional aspects of Polynesian societies. Various monarchs and nobles in Polynesian societies are believed to be the <strong>descendents of the pre historic ancestor figures</strong>. The tradition follows that these rulers have a <strong>semi divine element</strong> due to their ancestry and as such can exercise a prerogative not unlike that of a deity. Thus to a certain extent their decisions and their actions are beyond question or challenge.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Tu'i Tonga</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>In Tongan society the <strong>King is regarded as a descendent</strong> of 'Aho'eitu the <strong>first Tu'i Tonga</strong> and the nobles are regarded as <strong>descendents of his four brothers</strong>. Thus the monarchy and the nobility are <strong>all descendent from the god Tangaloa</strong>. This ancestry commands respect from the Tongan people who traditionally believe that this <strong>stratified society is divinely ordained</strong> and that the <strong>monarchy and nobles rule benevolently</strong> on behalf of the Tongan people.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Democratic reform</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>As Tongan society has become more westernised, the traditional beliefs have become less prevalent and in recent decades there has been a strong push for democratic reform in Tonga. Nevertheless, democracy advocates have considerable difficulty in convincing villagers in more remote areas that the <strong>social stratification</strong> of Tongan society is something that can be <strong>challenged and/or changed</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Ethical standards</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The second important relationship between traditional religion and the society is found in the <strong>ethical requirements for living</strong>. While there are <strong>no formulations of moral codes</strong>, there are strong <strong>indications in the actions of heroes</strong> such as Maui as to the type of <strong>ethical behaviour</strong> which can be expected.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Oral tradition</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>In Tongan society, for example, people will comment <strong>"that is not the Tongan way"</strong> when referring to an act of dishonesty or harm to others. The basis for this statement is not a set of laws or a code setting down appropriate practices. Rather if asked to explain why something is or is not ethical a Tongan is more likely to respond with a <strong>story from the oral tradition</strong> of their ancestor heroes which <strong>illustrates the point</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Taboos</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The third area relates to practices which are <strong>forbidden or taboo (tapu).</strong> Once again these prohibitions do not arise from a set of laws or a code but rather through the <strong>lesson drawn from an aspect of the oral tradition</strong>.</p>
