	    <h1>Specimen Question</h1>
		<p><strong>Outline the principal beliefs of one religion of ancient origin and analyse the individual and communal influence of these beliefs.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Describe the principal rituals associated with one religion of ancient origin and explain how these rituals express important beliefs of the religion.</strong></p>
		<h2>Sample Response</h2>
		<p><strong>Outline the principal beliefs of one religion of ancient origin and analyse the individual and communal influence of these beliefs. (8 marks)</strong></p>
		<p>Polynesian religions have significant influence on the traditional practices of both individuals and groups within the societies. These influences can be seen in the stratification of the societies with its accompanying relationships of respect and responsibility, in the ethical standards required and in the forbidden or taboo aspects of the society.</p>
		<p>The first example of a principal belief concerns the notion of ancestral heroes and the relationship of contemporary monarchs and nobles to these heroes and through them to the deities. In Polynesian religion there is a belief in the existence of ancestral heroes who have come into being through the union of a god with a human being. The current royalty and nobility in the society are believed to be the modern descendents of these ancestral heroes.</p>
		<p>Given the fact that the ancestral heroes are offspring of a union between a deity and a human being, the descendents of these heroes are regarded as descendents of the deities and therefore entitled to the utmost honour and respect in their community.</p>
		<p>While the monarchy and nobility are entitled to have the respect of their subjects due to their semi-divine status, they also have the responsibility to rule benevolently as their ancestor has done.</p>
		<p>Thus the stratification of the community with an expectation of benevolent leadership and respectful service is seen as a direct result of a principal belief, namely the existence of ancestral heroes.</p>
		<p>From the stories of these same ancestral heroes comes the second principal belief which relates to ethical requirements. In the stories of the ancestral figures, the theme of liberation from tyranny and oppression is a common motif. In and through these stories the Polynesian communities gain a sense of appropriate ethical behaviour.</p>
		<p>These ethical requirements do not come via a set of codes or laws but rather through lessons distilled from the stories of the ancestor figures which illustrate appropriate action of an ethical nature.</p>
		<p>Finally, the same process of distillation illustrates various practices in the society which are forbidden or taboo (tapu). These prohibitions are drawn from the stories of the ancestor heroes and help the community to identify practices which must be avoided.</p>
		<p>Therefore it can be seen that principal beliefs relating to the stratification of society, appropriate ethical behaviour and prohibitions within society all stem from a process of distillation of meaning from the stories of Polynesian mythology. The influence of these beliefs is clear both on an individual level and at a communal level.</p>

		<h2>Sample Response</h2>
		<p><strong>Describe the principal rituals associated with one religion of ancient origin and explain how these rituals express important beliefs of the religion. (6 marks)</strong></p>
		<p>The most significant ritual in Polynesian societies is the Kava ceremony. It is the ritual which would normally accompany any occasion of significance in Polynesian societies.</p>
		<p>The Kava ceremony, which owes its origins to a story of sacrifice in Polynesian mythology, is used primarily to welcome participants on an occasion of significance and also to acknowledge the importance of each person relative to all others present.</p>
		<p>The Kava ceremony is also used as a ritual of reconciliation, of anointing and of atonement. It can also be used to deliberately give offence or convey ill feeling if the situation requires. </p>
		<p>Thus while the Kava ceremony is a single ceremony it is in essence a number of rituals carried out in the same form but for different purpose and therefore with different significance.</p>
		<p>The Kava ceremony involves the ceremonial serving of a beverage made from the crushed root of the kava plant. It is carefully prepared and served from a large wooden or stone bowl. Guests are normally seated in a circle around the bowl. From this bowl, servings of the beverage are drawn in small cups usually made of coconut shells. With due ceremony and appropriate recognition the kava is offered first to the most highly esteemed person present. It is then offered, in turn, to each other person present, in order, according to their status.</p>
		<p>Considerable offence would be given if the kava were not served with appropriate respect and/or if the kava were not served in the appropriate order.</p>
		<p>The kava ceremony expresses the beliefs in Polynesian societies regarding the relative status of individuals. This status has a direct relationship to the stratification of the society derived from the stories of Polynesian mythology. It also incorporates beliefs in the importance of promoting harmonious relations and avoiding the giving of offence.</p>
		<p>It has been noted that there would scarcely be an occasion in Polynesian societies that would not involve a Kava ceremony. The centrality of this ritual to almost any event illustrates its significance and confirms that it is the most significant ritual element of Polynesian societies.</p>
