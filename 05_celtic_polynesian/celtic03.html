	    <h1>Content Description</h1>
		<h2>The role of the supernatural powers and deities in the religion</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>Diverse gods with diverse functions</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p><strong>Beliefs about the gods</strong> are not well known except that diverse gods had <strong>diverse</strong> functions. From evidence some members of society had a closer connection to one god more than another. For example, from an ancient inscription it was learned that shoemakers would tend more towards the god <strong>Lugos</strong>. It was believed that the gods lived in the '<strong>otherworld</strong>' and were in some kind of way connected to the '<strong>mythical ancestors</strong>' of the people which can be seen in the assignment of old huge <strong>grave mounds</strong> as their 'palaces' like <strong>Newgrange</strong>. It is understood that these gods lived on planet earth in the past, and only after their death became 'gods'. In this way it can be seen as ancestor worship.</p>
		  </div>		
          <div class="footnote"><p>Personification of the elements</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>In early thought everything was a person, in the broad meaning everything then possessed by a personality, hence many such 'persons' were worshipped - earth, sun, moon, sea, wind and other aspects of nature. This later led to more complete personification, and the sun or earth divinity or spirit was more or less separated from the sun or earth themselves. Some Celtic divinities thus evolved, but there still continued a veneration of the objects of nature themselves, as well as a cult of nature spirits or secondary divinities who peopled every part of nature.   A belief in divine beings filling heaven, earth, sea, air, glens, lochs, and rivers, and following human customs is revealed in oaths, odes, songs, stories, prayers and poems of the ancient Celts.</p></div>		
		</div>
		<h3>Goddesses and gods</h3> 
		<div class="content2">		 
          <div class="footnote"><p>Lugos and Matrona</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>There are over three hundred names for Celtic gods The Celtic gods had a lot of variants and it is most likely that the names of the <strong>goddesses</strong> and gods that have survived were mostly local and/or functional bynames of gods whose 'real' names were probably kept secret or which blend in with the bynames. Only two gods can be identified almost everywhere being the god Lugos - Irish Lugh and the mother goddess <strong>matrona</strong> (mother) to which a number of female names have been attributed, for example; <strong>Sequana</strong>, <strong>Noreia</strong>, <strong>Brigitana</strong>, <strong>Eriu</strong> and <strong>Boand</strong>.</p>
		  </div>		
		</div>
		<h3>The godly functions</h3>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>&nbsp;</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The <strong>Sky father</strong> usually referred to as the head of the <strong>pantheon</strong> and was often the god of thunder and lightening. The Irish deity is named Dagda in their <strong>mythology</strong>. The function of this god is that he is the progenitor of all other gods together with the earth mother. The Earth mother together with the Sky father is the parent of all the other gods. She is usually preserved in the figure of <strong>Danu</strong> in Irish mythology.</p>
		  </div>		
          <div class="footnote"><p>River goddesses</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The <strong>Matres</strong>, primarily the goddesses of fertility and plenty originated in an age when women cultivated the ground and the earth was a goddess whose cult was performed by <strong>priestesses</strong>. The Matres had more extensive functions; they were river-goddesses and the roots of names of many rivers can be traced back to the particular goddess, they were found as guardians of individuals, families, houses, of towns, a province, or a whole nation, guardians and presiding over rocks, springs, wells, fields and meadows. They also guarded women, especially in childbirth and when all the lineal descendents of the earth mother - Matrona.</p>
		  </div>		
          <div class="footnote"><p>Lower realm or Underworld</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The controller of the <strong>lower realm</strong> and his <strong>consort</strong> is usually the one who is in 
		    charge of the otherworld. Usually depicted with a great hammer and a dog by his side along with his 
			consort. The Irish legend of <strong>Curoi Mac Daire</strong> and <strong>Blathnat</strong> depicts this relationship. The god of the 
			underworld is the one in charge or the one who 'ferries' the dead there. The god is usually depicted 
			with a great hammer, a dog and his consort. The Irish legend of Curoi Mac Daire (Cu Roi meaning 
			&quot;Hound of the Plain&quot;) and Blathnat (&quot;little flower"&quot;).</p>
			<p>The goddess of the lower realm seems to have had a cow-like nature although she could change form to become an eel, snake, serpent or wolf. Her Irish equivalents are <strong>Boand</strong>, <strong>Brigit</strong> and <strong>Morrigan</strong>. Through intercourse with the Sky father she begets a god named 'son', who later marries his aunt, the goddess of the <strong>middle realm</strong> - Boand is the mother of the Irish Mac ind &quot;young son&quot; and this god seems to have been associated with fire.</p>
		  </div>		
          <div class="footnote"><p>Middle realm</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The goddess of the middle realm is known in the Irish form as <strong>Medb or Aife</strong> and she had a son with the Sky father, called Nechtain-Freach (the son of Medb) who seems to be associated with water.</p>
			<p>The daytime and night time controller of the <strong>upper realm</strong> is usually fulfilled by two gods, characteristically split between a one-eyed god and a one-handed god as seen in the Cath Maige Tuired where the one-handed Nuade preceded the god <strong>Lugh</strong>. Lugh (lug means "burn, enflame") and so the association with the sun was made. A link between the controller of the summer half of the year and the festival of Lughnasad can also be made. The goddess of the upper realm is usually depicted as a horse, her Irish equivalent is <strong>Macha</strong>. The name Macha may also indicate that there is a melding of the Earth goddess with the Upper realm goddess.</p>
		  </div>		
          <div class="footnote"><p>Cuchullin - youthful  saviour champion</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The youthful-saviour-champion god was fulfilled in Irish texts by <strong>Cuchullin</strong> and mixes with the function of the Nightime upper realm controller. This god was the warrior champion of the tribe and probably the god to whom the Celtic warrior bands would pray as he would protect the cattle of the tribe, would go into a battle frenzy and fought naked.</p>
		    <p>The goddess of war is known as a triplicate goddess from the Irish mythology in the forms of <strong>Morrigan (Great Queen), Nemain (Battle Frenzy) and Babd (Cow)</strong> often referred to as the <strong>tres Morrigan</strong> &quot;The Three Great Queens&quot;. The three goddesses could shift into the form of a raven and Babd was also referred to as Babd catha &quot;Battle Crow&quot;.</p>
		    <p>The Irish god <strong>Ogma mac Elathan of the Tuatha De Danann</strong> in Cath Maige Tuired is credited with the invention of the <strong>Ogam alphabet</strong> and is therefore the god of oratory.</p>
