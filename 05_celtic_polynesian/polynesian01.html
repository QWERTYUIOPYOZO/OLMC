	    <h1>Content Description</h1>
		<h2>Principal beliefs concerning the origins of the universe</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>Location of Polynesian islands</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>Polynesian societies are found in the <strong>South Pacific</strong> area of <strong>Oceania</strong>. Other islanders from the Oceanic region are known as Melanesians and Micronesians. Polynesians come mostly from groups of islands such as the Cook Islands, Fiji, New Zealand, American and Western Samoa and Tonga. Other smaller islands such as Tuvalu and Niue are also regarded as Polynesian.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Variety yet similarity of beliefs and practices</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>While there are clearly <strong>cultural and historical variations</strong> among the different Polynesian societies they do, nevertheless, share <strong>many things in common</strong>. This variety and commonality is also evident in the traditional religious beliefs and mythology of the Polynesian people</p>
		    <p><strong>Creation stories vary</strong> across the range of Polynesian islands, however, they frequently present and image of a <strong>time of primal chaos</strong> with the world being <strong>created or formed from the sea</strong> by a first creator god usually usually known as Ta'aroa or Tangaloa.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Primal parents</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>Alternately and sometimes concurrently stories are told of the separation of the <strong>primal parents</strong>  with the "Sky Father" figure known variously as Atea or Rangi or Vatea or Wakea  being separated from  the &quot;Earth-mother&quot;  figure and the subsequent <strong>formation of earthly life</strong> through the work of the gods.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Origins of human life</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>In some places the god <strong>Kane or Tane</strong> is credited with the origin of human life. The <strong>divine beings inhabit the spiritual world</strong> which is seen as a separate world above the earthly world, yet they remain <strong>actively concerned</strong> with the everyday activities of the humans. </p>
			<p>The following is an example of a Polynesian Creation Myth from Tonga.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Polynesian creation myth</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>In the beginning there was <strong>just the sea, and the spirit world, Pulotu</strong>; and between them was a rock called Touia'o Futuna. On the Rock lived Biki and his twin sister, Kele, 'Atungaki and his twin sister, Maimoa'o Longona, Fonua'uta and his twin sister, Fonuavai, and Hemoana and his twin sister, Lupe. <strong>Biki lay with his own sister and she bore him two children</strong>, a son, Taufulifonua, and a daughter, Havea Lolofonua; 'Atungaki also lay with his sister and she bore him a daughter, Velesi'i.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Birth of Tangaloa and Maui</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>When Taufulifonua grew to manhood, his sister, Havea Lolofonua, bore him a son, Hikule'o, Velelahi bore him a son, <strong>Tangaloa</strong>, and Velesi'i bore him a son, <strong>Maui</strong>. Hikule'o, Tangaloa and Maui divided the creation between them. Hikule'o took as his portion, Pulotu, <strong>Tangaloa took the sky and Maui the underworld</strong>. Hemoana, whose form was a sea snake, and Lupe, whose form was a dove, then divided the remainder between them, Hemoana taking the sea and Lupe taking the land.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Tangaloa and the sky gods</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p><strong>Tangaloa had several sons in the sky</strong>: Tangaloa Tamapo'uli'Alamafoa, Tangaloa 'Eitumatupu'a, Tangaloa'Atulongolongo and Tangaloa Tufunga. Old Tangaloa grew tired of looking down from the sky and seeing nothing but sea, so he sent down Tangaloa'Atulongolongo in the form of a plover to <strong>see if he could find land</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>The formation of land in the sea</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>All Tangaloa'Atulongolongo could find was <strong>a reef below the water</strong>, where 'Ata is now. So Old Tangaloa told Tangaloa Tufunga to <strong>throw down into the sea the chips from the wood carving</strong> on which he was working. Tangaloa Tufunga continued to do this for a  very long time, and on two other occasions Tangaloa'Atulongolongo <strong>flew down in the form of a plover</strong> to see if anything had happened, but he found nothing. On the third occasion, however, he found that <strong>the chips had formed an island</strong>. This was 'Eua. Later, Tangaloa Tufunga threw down more chips to form the island of Kao and Tofua.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Maui and the fish hook</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>Tongatapu and most of the <strong>other islands were the work of Maui</strong>. One day Maui visited Manu'a and there and old man, Tonga Fusifonua, gave him a fish-hook. Maui went fishing with this hook, but when he tried to pull in his line he found it was caught. He exerted all his strength and succeeded in hauling the line in, to find that <strong>he had dragged up Tongatapu from the bottom of the sea</strong>. Maui continued fishing with this wonderful hook and so <strong>pulled up from the deeps</strong> the rest of the islands of Tonga, and some of those of Fiji and Samoa as well.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Principal Beliefs</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>From this story and various other Polynesian creation myths a number of elements can be drawn which amount to principal beliefs relating to creation.</p></div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>The importance of the sea</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>Firstly there is the <strong>prominence of the sea</strong> and its significance for Polynesian people. Polynesian societies are often described as <strong>ocean communities</strong>. Their communities live on relatively tiny parcels of land sprinkled across vast stretches of the Pacific Ocean. Their lives are inextricably tied to the sea and its creatures and these elements feature enormously in their beliefs about creation.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Human qualities in deities</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The second element is the <strong>personification of the deities</strong> and their endowment with attributes which are stereotypically human. Thus the <strong>deities are the origin of the human form</strong> with its particular characteristics. An example of this is the god "Maui" who has mischievous inclinations and is often portrayed as a trickster. Such mischievous inclinations are prevalent among Polynesian people and there are various sayings which affectionately identify the mischievous intent in people as a characteristic of Maui.</p>
		  </div>	
          <div class="footnote"><p>Link between human and divine</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>A third element is the emphasis on sexual congress among the gods and in many cases between a god and a human being. This interaction between the deities and humankind is a way of <strong>portraying the origins of humankind</strong> and also conveying the idea of an <strong>ongoing relationship between the human and the divine</strong>. It is also a way of indicating a <strong>divine presence or essence in the human</strong> and therefore affirming the <strong>dignity of the human person</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Separation of physical and spiritual worlds</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>Finally the creation myths portray a degree of separation from the physical world of the humans and the spiritual world of the gods. This separation is a <strong>source of awe</strong> and <strong>respect for the spiritual world</strong> and highlights the understanding of the transcendent in the Polynesian stories. </p>
