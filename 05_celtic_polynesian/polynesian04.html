          <div class="footnote"><p>Kava ceremony</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The most significant ritual practice among Polynesian societies is the Kava or 'Ava ceremony. The ceremony is a <strong>traditional ritual of welcome and acknowledgement</strong> of the status of visitors and in particular dignitaries. It involves the ritual drinking of a beverage made from the <strong>crushed root of the kava plant</strong>. The kava is served in a cup often made from a coconut shell with the beverage drawn from a central carved wooden or stone bowl. The <strong>most highly esteemed person present is first presented with the kava to drink</strong> and then with due ceremony the kava is then shared by each person <strong>in order according to their social status</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Origins of the Kava ceremony</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The kava ceremony relates back to a <strong>mythical beginning</strong> when Momo, the King of Tonga and the tenth Tu'i Tonga took part in a failed fishing expedition to the east of the Island of Tongatapu. The royal party returned to shore hungry and in a state of exhaustion. They landed on the small islet of 'Eueki which was inhabited by a poor family of commoner standing. </p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Offering to the King</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The <strong>presence of the King</strong> obliged the family to <strong>make an offering</strong> and they intended to harvest their tarot plant for the offering. However, the found the King resting against it and realised therefore that it was now <strong>tapu (taboo) because the King had touched it</strong>. Having nothing else to offer they decided to <strong>offer their daughter Kava'onau as a sacrifice</strong>. They killed her and baked her in an 'umu (earth oven). </p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>'Umu becomes a grave</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>When the King realised what had taken place he ordered the family <strong>not to uncover the 'umu</strong> but to use it as <strong>Kava'onau's grave</strong>. In time <strong>kava and sugarcane grew from the grave</strong> and this was then used to create the kava drink for the formal kava ceremony.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Ceremony serves many purposes</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The kava ceremony is <strong>singularly the most significant ritual element of Polynesian societies</strong>. It serves a variety of purposes from <strong>welcome, reconciliation, anointing, atonement</strong> etc. There is virtually no significant occasion which would not include a kava ceremony.</p>
		    <p>A kava ceremony involves <strong>strict protocols</strong>, particularly relating to the order in which those present are offered the kava cup. The most highly esteemed is served first and then others follow in order of their social status. On occasions where a host has wanted to <strong>give offence to a guest</strong> or to <strong>indicate ill feeling</strong> between parties they do so by not offering the kava in the appropriate order. Not offering the kava in the appropriate order is a <strong>guaranteed way to give offence</strong>. </p>
