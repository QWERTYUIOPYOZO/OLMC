		<h2>Rituals</h2>
		<p>Celtic rituals can be divided into five areas:</p>
		<ol>
          <li>Rituals performed at seasonal feasts</li>
          <li>Transmigration rituals such as initiation rites</li>
          <li>Divinatory rituals</li>
          <li>Curative processes</li>
          <li>Magical rituals</li>

		  <div class="text">
		    <p><strong>Seasonal rituals</strong> accompanied the great seasonal feasts of the Irish Celts and were situated throughout the year as follows;</p>
		    <p><strong>Samhain</strong> - the Celtic New Year began on the 1st November. Rituals held during this time were probably protective as the barrier to the other world was thin at this time and possibly spent remembering the dead.</p>
			<p><strong>Imbolc</strong> - the ritual was held around 1st or 2nd of February and had something to do with milk deduced from the word 'Eumelc' that is another name for the ritual. <strong>Eumelc</strong> means &quot;first milking&quot;.</p>
			<p><strong>Beltane</strong> - a ritual held on 1st of May and was associated with fire. It involved rituals in which cows were driven between two fires, possibly a purification ritual.</p>
			<p><strong>Lughnasad</strong> - a ritual only held in Ireland. It was probably an August  harvest feast possibly centering on the marriage between the Earth goddess and Lugh with lots of contests of skill and strength.</p>

          <div class="footnote"><p>Rites of initiation</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p><strong>Transmigration rituals</strong> such as name giving, various initiation rites until adulthood was reached, inauguration rites to kingship and finally death rites. From the story of <strong>Mabinogi</strong> where the mother of <strong>Llew</strong> has to be tricked into giving him a name and after three other 'initiations' he is considered a man. The youngest children found in Celtic graveyards usually are no younger than 3 to 4 years, approximately the time when they began to speak.</p>
		    <p>Initiations to weapons as found in the boyhood deeds of <strong>Cuchullin</strong> who is also not allowed to <strong>Emer</strong> until he has special training "initiation with the famous <strong>Scathach</strong>. From the <strong>Finn saga</strong> we learn that acceptance requires the applicant to succeed a test, which has many ritualistic elements.</p>
		    <p>The initiation to kingship rituals varies from place to place and in time. However, the best information on ancient Celtic rituals is found in these rituals. Rituals such as the king being carried by his followers standing on his shield and the king stepping into a &quot;footprint&quot;.</p>
			<p>Death rituals included a big feast in the area of the graveyard area including a piece of meat and a container with drink - most often a beer or wine, especially for the richer dead. Grave goods were included in the grave pointing to a ritual process sometimes these items were &quot;<strong>ritually killed</strong>&quot;.</p>
		    <p><strong>Divinatory rituals</strong> usually carried out by Druids who were able to predict the future from bird flight and from an examination of  the intestines and innards of dead birds, or from observation of the death throws of a sacrificial human.</p>

          <div class="footnote"><p>Rituals for healing and restoration</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p><strong>Curative rituals</strong> such as those associated with springs reflected a belief in the restorative powers of water or even that of rebirth. Rituals such as immersion in sacred water and the offering of equivalent models of injured parts were used in the curative rituals. The ancient Celts did practice trepanation - the surgical opening of the skull. In the <strong>Cath Maige Tuired</strong>, <strong>Miach the son of Dian Cecht</strong> used a curative incantation to heal the severed Arm of Nuada, the king of the <strong>Tuatha Da Danann</strong> - &quot;joint to joint of it, and sinew to sinew&quot; <cite>(http://draeconin.com/database/celtreli.htm)</cite></p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Magic and sacrifice</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p><strong>Magical Rituals</strong> included the collection of curative plants and is relayed through such stories as that of the Druids and their  acquisition of the sacred <strong>Mistletoe</strong> as told by <strong>Pliny the elder</strong>. Pliny describes how the druid puts his right arm through the left sleeve of his clothing and cuts, with a golden sickle, the mistletoe, which is caught in a white cloth. He tells of the collection of other plants and the practice of jumping on one leg around the plant in a left hand direction. Blessings and curses were invoked by calling a god to do something to somebody else and evidence of these were found on such things as lead plates.</p>
            <p>Human sacrifice such as that of the <strong>Lindow man</strong>, the bog body from Lindow moss in England was ritualistically killed. Archaeological reconstruction revealed that he had suffered a <strong>'threefold' death</strong>, that is, he was hit on the head, probably with an axe, although he was not hit hard enough so that he died instantly. Then he was strangled with a <strong>Garrotte</strong>. However, this did not cause instant death and so finally he was thrown in a pool in Lindow moss, face down, unconscious so that he drowned. He died a 'threefold' death. Other stories of 'threefold' deaths support the idea that the ancient Celtic peoples practised a ritualistic killing where humans were sacrificed.</p>                           
		    <p><strong>Headhunting</strong> was connected to beliefs in the power of the head of the victim and was practised by the ancient Celts. The heads of enemies were hung at saddlebow or fixed on spears of warriors as they returned home from battle. Heads were hung on walls of palaces, preserved in cedar-wood oil or in <strong>coffers</strong>, piled high in a room of a palace or set high atop a stake, heads were counted after battle and warriors often produced tongues of enemies as evidence of their prowess.</p>
            <p>There were <strong>spells</strong> associated with women - <strong>brichta ban</strong>, and with the Druid priests who claimed to have great power over the natural elements. Stories of spells that caused invisibility - <strong>feth fiada</strong>, Druids that were able to throw mountains and had the power to make stones and rocks appear as armed men, of the daughters of <strong>Calatin</strong> who raised themselves aloft on an enchanted wind all reveal belief in the power of spells and magic.</p>
