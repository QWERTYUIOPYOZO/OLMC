	    <h1>Specimen Question</h1>
		<p><strong>Outline the principal beliefs of one religion of ancient origin and analyse the individual and communal influence of these beliefs.</strong></p>
		<h2>Sample Response</h2>
        <p><strong>Outline the principal beliefs of one religion of ancient origin and analyse the individual and communal influence of these beliefs.</strong></p>		
		<p>The principal rituals of the ancient Celts were the seasonal celebratory rituals of Samhain - November, Imbolc - February, Beltane - May and Lughnasad  - August , the transmigrational rituals, along with magical, curative and divinatory rituals.</p>
		<p>The seasonal rituals denoted the changes in season and expressed the concern for physical and spiritual survival. Archaeological evidence suggests they involved celebrations and feasting along with rituals that denoted an agrarian society that used natural elements such as cattle, milk, fire and human feats of strength in symbolic rituals.</p>
		<p>It is difficult to determine the extent or the influence that the rituals had on the individual or the community as the ancient Celts left no written records.  It is theorised that the seasonal rituals were concerned with protection from ghosts from the lower realm underworld at Samhain, the symbolic use of milk at Imbolc, a purification ceremony involving fire at Beltane and a autumn harvest feast at Lughnasad prior to the northern hemisphere winter.</p>
		<p>Transmigrational rituals such as namegiving, various initiation rites into adulthood, inauguration to kingship and death rituals would have existed but there is little evidence apart from the stories that have survived the ancient Celtic culture. The Mabinogi texts refer to the naming of a child and other initiations into manhood along with the Cuchullin tales of initiation into weapons and sex. The Finn saga tells of tests that warriors have to suceed in prior to joing the warrior bands.The inauguration of the king in the white mare ritual of Connacht is an example of symbolic beleifs.  Burial sites suggest elaborate rituals connected to death.</p>
		<p>Inauguration to kingship included elaborate and symbolic rituals that ensured that the king was physically and morally strong and hence a perfect king. The future of the tribe depended on the king and his prowess, fertility, wisdom and moral integrity and the qualities played a large part in good management of the society.</p>
		<p>The evidence from ancient Celtic graveyards such as bones of small animals, containers used for beer or wine indicates that a big feast was held at burial sites. The bodies of the dead also had items placed in the grave which reveals ritualistic preparation for burial and final interment. The symbolic significance of the rituals to the ancient Celtic people is not known but the rituals themselves point to an belief in some of afterlife or of travel to another level of existence beyond this life and thus reveals a religious dimension and the human search for meaning.</p>
		<p>Magical rituals such as those described by Pliny the Elder shows that the Druids practised ritual behaviours when collecting the Mistletoe and other plants for their curative qualities. The immersion of body parts in sacred springs or models of body parts placed in the water indicated a ritual possibly accompanied by chants or prayers.</p>
		<p>The collection of plants and the elaborate rituals used to trick the spirits of the plants shows that the ancient Celts believed in the power of the plants to cure them. Human sacrifice and head hunting practised by Celtic peoples would have had a ritualistic dimension although the meaning for the Celts has not been passed on and archaeologists and anthropologists conjecture as to the significance to individuals and the community.</p>
		<p>Physical survival and the human search for meaning were all connected for ancient peoples. For the ancient Celts magic, superstition, quasi-scientific knowledge, medicines and cures, wars, agriculture, hunting all involved rituals and religious beliefs.</p>
