		<h2>Principal beliefs of the religion</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>Celtic calendar</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p><strong>Calendarical Beliefs</strong> are the best-documented part of Celtic beliefs as shown in the Coligny calendar. The &quot;Celtic calendar&quot; was a way to reconcile lunations and the solar year. The oldest material Celtic calendar is the fragmented Coligny calendar, which was discovered in Coligny, France, in 1897. It uses Roman numerals and dates to the 1st century, BC or AD, a time when the Roman Empire imposed use of the Julian calendar in Roman Gaul. The <strong>astronomical</strong> format of the calendar year that the Coligny calendar represents is likely to be far older. The date of its inception is unknown, but correspondences of Insular Celtic and Continental Celtic calendars suggest that some early form may date to <strong>Proto-Celtic</strong> times, roughly 800 BC.</p>		
            <p>An <strong>engraved</strong> stone found at <strong>Knowth, Ireland</strong>, is a <strong>graphical</strong> representation of a <strong>lunar calendar</strong> that operates on the same principle as the Coligny calendar.</p></div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Cycle of lunar months</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The Coligny calendar registers a cycle of lunar months, divided in a &quot;bright&quot; and a &quot;dark&quot; half-moon or fortnight each. The months were taken to begin at full moon, and a 13th <strong>intercalary</strong> month was added every two or three years to align the <strong>lunations</strong> with the solar year.</p>	
            <p>The first part of the year started at <strong>Samhain</strong>, which was around the first of November, never far from what would become Halloween and the following All Saints Day in our modern solar calendar.  The second part of the year started at <strong>Beltaine</strong>, which was around the first of May. The Coligny calendar is now in the Gallo-Roman museum of Lyon.</p>
		    <p>Celtic days began at sundown: <em>&quot;they keep birthdays and the beginnings of months and years in such an order that the day follows the night,&quot;</em> their adversary Julius Caesar observed in <strong>&quot;Gallic Wars&quot;</strong>. Longer periods were reckoned in nights, as in the surviving term &quot;fortnight.&quot; <cite>(Brennan, Martin, 1994)</cite></p>

		  <div class="footnote"><p>Protective symbols</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p><strong>Apotropaic beliefs</strong> are beliefs in the power of protection. The frequent '<strong>amulets</strong>' found in the graves of young Celtic children and adults have indicated this. It has been revealed in the decoration of jewelry and weaponry, depictions of animals and human faces can be seen as <strong>protective symbols</strong> to ward off evil spirits.</p>		
            <p>As a tabu <strong>geas, geis or geasa pl.</strong> played a large part in Irish life. In some cases geasa were based on ideas of right and wrong, honour and dishonour, or were intended to avoid unlucky days. More prohibitions applied to kings as they had an important role in ancient Celtic society and the welfare of the tribe depended on them. Geasa could be imposed by anyone in the form of incantations and spells that were believed in by everyone and thus commanded obedience or protection.</p></div>

		<h3>Beliefs in the spirits of nature</h3>
		<div class="content2"> 	
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Protective quality of plants</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>A belief in the spirits of nature in the Celtic religion is accepted as relatively certain. Descriptions from <strong>Pliny the Elder</strong> that describe the <strong>Druids</strong> (from later on in the history of the Celts) and their ritual behaviour when collecting plants indicates a belief in the <strong>apotropaic qualities</strong> of plants and also a belief in magic. For example putting the right arm which was considered the 'dangerous' arm through the left sleeve in order to trick the plant into thinking it is safe until it is too late and it is pulled up or cut and thus collected for use. However, the extent to which a belief in the spirits of nature and their influence on everyday lives of the Celts is not known. Tree and plant worship was believed to be widespread among the Celts. The Celts made their sacred places in dark groves, the trees being hung with offerings or the heads of victims.</p>
		  </div>		
          <div class="footnote"><p>Spirits dwelling in trees</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Trees were believed to be the abode of the spirits or <strong>divinities</strong> that in many cases had power over vegetation.  Pliny wrote of the Celts, <em>&quot;They esteem nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and the tree on which it grows. But apart from this they choose oak-woods for their sacred groves, and perform no sacred rite without using oak branches&quot;.</em> <cite>(http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/rac/rac16.htm)</cite></p>		
            <p><strong>Beliefs about Healing</strong> have been linked to offerings that were made to goddesses of such things as <strong>sacred springs</strong> such as those of Sequana. Surgery such as <strong>trepanation</strong> - the opening of the skull could have been connected to a special belief given that the ancient Celtic religion revered the head.</p></div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Significance of the head as the place of the soul</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p><strong>Beliefs about the head</strong> are indicated in ancient sources in stories of how the 
		    heads of enemies were kept as family treasures and that such heads would not even be sold 
			for their weight in gold. Monuments such as the one in <strong>Roquepertuse</strong> where a stone portal was 
			adorned with human skulls, separate skulls found in settlements and amulets made of human skull 
			bones all reveal a special reverence for the head. In the story of Conchobar he keeps the brain 
			of one of his enemies conserved, which is later stolen and used as a slingshot against him, which 
			later causes his death thus conveying the 'power' inherent in the brain. It is speculated that the 
			head contained the soul and that the one who had the head of a person also had the soul of the person. 
			In the <strong>story of Bran</strong> who tells his companions to sever his head and to carry it around the country 
			before burying it in London facing east to ward off any enemies. During the 87 year long journey 
			Bran's head remains alive telling of wonders until its final <strong>interment</strong>.</p></div>		
          <div class="footnote"><p>Wellbeing of the king reflected in the wellbeing of the land</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p><strong>Beliefs about kingship</strong> of the ancient <strong>Celtic kings</strong> is not known however ideas have been gathered from the Irish archaeological evidence that the wellbeing of the king was reflected in the wellbeing of the land. A king who had lost his perfect appearance reflected this back onto the land hence a scarred king or a king who had lost a limb would not be able to be king. It was not only a matter of physical perfection but also mental wellbeing. A ruler had to be just as injustice would immediately fall back on the country. If a king was greedy and did not give his gifts freely then nature would not yield a <strong>bountiful</strong> crop.</p>
            <p><strong>Belief in Magic</strong> is evident though what sort of magic is unclear. The most obvious one is what the Irish called <strong>Geis</strong>, or the plural Gessa, which means prohibition or taboo. Such gessa could be anything from not eating in the company of three women to not hunting birds. It could also be included in tests of the kind for example in a statement like, &quot;.it is geis for you to not return here until you have done this or that&quot;.</p></div>
