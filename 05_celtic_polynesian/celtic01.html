		<h3>Celtic Origins of the universe</h3>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>No written accounts</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The Celts were a group of ancient peoples that occupied lands stretching from the British Isles to Gallatia between 2000 and 50 BCE. The Celts had many dealings with other cultures that bordered their lands. There are no written records of the Celts stemming from their own documents so there is only <strong>archaeological</strong> evidence and historical accounts to provide information about them. Unfortunately the Celts left no account of their religion. Therefore, only interpretations based on the existing materials and comparative studies of other ancient religions have been used to reconstruct ideas and concepts about the religion of the Ancient Celts.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Myths conveyed in poems and hymns</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The Celts may have had a <strong>cosmogony</strong> that included a Heaven and Earth <strong>myth</strong>, but there is no remaining evidence of it. There are references in Irish texts that point to a common <strong>cosmogonic myth</strong> of the earth having gradually evolved to its present form. There are remnants of myths showing how the sky is supported by trees, a mountain, or by pillars.  In an old Irish hymn Brigit and Patrick are compared to two pillars of the world. This is possibly an <strong>allusion</strong> to an old myth of sky or earth resting on pillars. In an old Irish poem it tells of the <em><strong>drochet bethad</strong></em> - 'bridge of life', or in the <em>drochaid na flaitheanas</em> - 'bridge of heaven'. This would indicate that a bridge links heaven and earth. The <strong>gods</strong> that were connected with the sky were believed to dwell there or on the mountain that supported it.</p>

          <div class="footnote"><p>Human beings descended from the gods</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The Celts believed that gods dwelt in groves, rivers, wells and trees, mounds and hills and not in one particular mountain. Some writers believe that the <em><strong>Tuatha De Danann</strong></em> - the children or tribe of the gods, have come from heaven by but this may only be an interpretation. The Celtic belief was that men descended from the gods not that they were created by them.</p>
		  </div>		
          <div class="footnote"><p>Earth mother</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>There is no complete myth about the creation of the world. Most scholars speculate that myths about an Earth Mother giving birth to a child as indicated in similar indigenous groups of the time was a possible belief. Myths about the creation of geographical features attribute bodies of water to the tears of giants, or wells to the touch of a fairy, islands thrown up by the digging of giants. It is thought that giants and fairies have replaced the ancient gods of the Celtic myths. For example in the story of the god <strong>Manannan</strong> it is his tears at the death of his son that formed three <strong>lochs</strong> in Erin.</p>
			<p>Although there is no complete account of the end of all things, the <strong>Conchobar</strong> story may refer to it. Conchobar announced he would rescue the captives and spoils taken by Medb, <em>unless the heavens fell, the earth burst open and the sea engulphed everything</em> thus indicating a belief in a final cataclysm.</p>
