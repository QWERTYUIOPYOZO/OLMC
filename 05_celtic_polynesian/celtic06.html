		<h2>How the religion provides a distinctive response to the search for meaning</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>Rituals, festivals and celebrations</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The struggle for physical survival and the emergence of agriculture and hunting with their associated beliefs, magical spells and curses, superstitions, gods, goddesses, rituals, festivals and celebrations gave meaning to life and explained forces over which the ancient Celtic people had no control. The evidence of the  worship of Nature conveyed their reliance on the natural world.</p>
		    <p>However, their search for meaning and understanding of the <strong>natural phenomena</strong> and events relayed in <strong>archaeological evidence</strong> that indicated an attempt to transcend the material world and become associated with the forces that they believed had control over the material world they inhabited. The gods and goddesses, the elaborate rituals, the blessings and curses, the prayers, the secret knowledge of the women and the Druids, <strong>the</strong> <strong>magical chants</strong>, the <strong>superstitions</strong> and <strong>taboos</strong> all pointed to the human need and the human potential for connection with the transcendent.</p>
			<p>The <strong>myths</strong> and stories of the Celts passed down from generation to generation woven together in a rich tapestry of tales of queens and kings, heroes and heroines, gods and goddesses, women and men who experienced both marvellous and terrible times. The involvement of animals and trees, plants, springs, rivers, rocks, mountains, and the world of nature with human beings revealed a connected and inspirited landscape rich with meaning.</p>

          <div class="footnote"><p>Soul lives on after death</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The Celts believed that the soul lived on after death. The concept of <strong>Elysium</strong> is found in a series of Irish tales where the gods inhabited an underworld within the hills or on an island obscured by mist. In Irish <strong>sagas</strong>, <strong>rebirth</strong> was only possible for <strong>divinities</strong> or heroes and there is no evidence that refers to ordinary mortals <strong>transmigrated</strong>.</p>
		    <p>Sites such as the <strong>Megalithic Passage Tombs of  Newgrange, Knowth, Dowth, Fourknocks, Loughcrew and Tara</strong> are located in the present day County of Meath on the east coast of Ireland. It is believed that he Boyne Valley Mounds at Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth were built around 3200BC, which would make them older than Stonehenge in England and the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. Evidence suggests that <strong>Neolithic</strong> farming communities built them about 5000 years ago. Archaeologists have determined that the passage tombs have clear astronomical alignments such as the <strong>Winter Solstice</strong> at <strong>Newgrange</strong> and the <strong>Equinox Sunrise</strong> at <strong>Loughcrew</strong>.</p>

          <div class="footnote"><p>Function of megalithic structures</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The splendour and magnificence of <strong>Newgrange and Knowth</strong> indicate that the temples of the ancestors were places of <strong>astrological</strong>, spiritual, religious and ceremonial importance where important rulers may have been buried. There is much debate about the function and purpose of the <strong>megalithic structures</strong>. Were they built primarily as <strong>burial tombs</strong>, <strong>sacred temples</strong> or <strong>astronomical observatories</strong>?</p>
		    <p>Although there are no written records from the Celts themselves historians, <strong>archaeologists, anthropologists</strong> and historical observers of the Celts have deduced from the naming of children, initiation rituals to the elaborate burials of nobles and heroes that the religion of the ancient Celts gave meaning to their lives.</p>
