          <li>Spiritual world of gods separated from physical world of human beings</li>		
		</ul>
		<h3>Principal beliefs of the religion</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Main concern of religion was the protection of people from spiritual powers</li>
          <li>Religion needed to keep the divine and physical worlds in harmony</li>
          <li>Gods frequently aligned with aspects of nature and natural occurrences</li>
          <li>Ancestral heroes born from liaison between a god and a human being</li>
          <li>Ancestral figures embodied in elements of the environment</li>
          <li>After death spirits of the dead dwell in an unstratified underworld</li>		
		</ul>
		<h3>The role of the supernatural powers and deities in the religion</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Gods are usually personification of an aspect of nature</li>
          <li>Most gods are male figures</li>
          <li>Female principle is powerfully evident in Papa the earth mother</li>
          <li>The main activities of gods are associated with natural occurrences</li>
          <li>Gods are not characteristically benevolent or malevolent</li>
          <li>Common feature of supernatural beings is their propensity to procreate with a human partner</li>
          <li>Offspring of these unions are regarded as ancestors of modern human beings</li>
          <li>Stories of hero figures depict them in activities overcoming tyranny and oppression</li>
          <li>Maui and Tawhaki are two prominent examples of hero figures</li>
          <li>These actions are seen as allegories for the actions required of human beings today</li>
          <li>This is especially so with regard to the ruling classes who hold titles descendent from the ancestor figures</li>
          <li>The existence of descendents of ancestral heroes in Polynesian societies for the basis for social stratification of the communities.</li>
          <li>The descendents of the ancestral heroes have a moral obligation to provide for the wellbeing of their subjects</li>
          <li>The title of Tu'i Tonga held by the King of Tonga is a clear example of the tradition of ancestral heroes and titles</li>
          <li>The title of Tu'i Tonga is traced back to the sexual liaison between the god Tangaloa and the woman 'Ilaheva</li>
          <li>The story of the Tu'i Tonga conveys the origins of the royal dynasty an also the structure of the nobility in Tongan society</li>		
		</ul>
		<h3>The relationship between sacred spaces and the beliefs of the religion</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>In traditional Polynesian societies tribal life was centered around an area of sacred space</li>
          <li>In this area various rituals could be carried out involving song, dance, chanting of sacred formulae and the drinking of kava.</li>
          <li>The sacred space could also serve as a community meeting place and in particular as a place of discussion and decision making for community elders.</li>
          <li>The ritual elements carried are intended to provide a means of ensuring the safe ordering of society and to avoid causing offence to any of the spirits.</li>
          <li>The communal discussion and decision making dimensions are intended to ensure appropriate adherence to ethical codes within the society.</li>
          <li>In Tongan society a number of sacred houses exist for different purposes</li> 
          <li>One serves as a priestly sanctuary</li>
          <li>The sacred house also served as a sanctuary for exiles</li>
          <li>Women and children could also take shelter there in times of war.</li> 
          <li>Another type of sacred house existed as a shelter to the tomb of local nobility Another important site in Tongan society was the meeting place known as Fale Fakataha</li>
          <li>This house would normally have a tiered structure where people could be seated according to their status</li> 
          <li>It would be used for ceremonial kava drinking as well as community meetings and any other important village gatherings</li>		
		</ul>
		<h3>Principal rituals and their significance for the individual and community</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>The most significant ritual practice among Polynesian societies is the Kava ceremony</li> 
          <li>There is virtually no significant occasion in Polynesian society which does not incorporate a Kava ceremony</li>
          <li>The ceremony is a traditional ritual of welcome and acknowledgement of the status of visitors and in particular dignitaries</li> 
          <li>The Kava ceremony involves the ritual drinking of a beverage made from the crushed root of the kava plant</li>
          <li>The kava is served in a cup often made from a coconut shell with the beverage drawn from a central carved wooden or stone bowl</li>
          <li>The most highly esteemed person present is first presented with the kava to drink and then with due ceremony the kava is then shared by each person in order according to their social status</li>
          <li>The Kava ceremony has its origins in the story of Kava'onau who was sacrificed in an offering to the king. Her grave became the source of the kava plant</li>		
		</ul>
		<h3>The relationship between the religion and its society</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Polynesian societies were always stratified to greater or lesser degrees</li>
          <li>Social stratification is aligned with belief in descendents of ancestor heroes</li>
          <li>Ethical standards are aligned with legendary actions of ancestor heroes</li>
          <li>Social taboos are aligned with elements of mythical stories</li>
          <li>In Tongan society the King is regarded as a descendent of 'Aho'eitu the first Tu'i Tonga and the nobles are regarded as descendents of his four brothers.</li> 
          <li>Thus the monarchy and the nobility are all descendent from the god Tangaloa</li>
          <li>This ancestry commands respect from the Tongan people who traditionally believe that this stratified society is divinely ordained and that the monarchy and nobles rule benevolently on behalf of the Tongan people</li>
          <li>While there are no formulations of moral codes, there are strong indications in the actions of heroes such as Maui as to the type of ethical behaviour which can be expected.</li>
          <li>If asked to explain why something is or is not ethical a Tongan is more likely to respond with a story from the oral tradition of their ancestor heroes which illustrates the point</li>
          <li>Taboo elements do not arise from a set of laws but rather through lessons drawn from aspects of the oral tradition</li>		
		</ul>
		<h3>How the religion provides a distinctive response to the search for meaning</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Myths and stories of the gods and ancestor figures provide an understanding of the relationship to their environment.</li>
          <li>Life in Polynesian societies has traditionally been closely aligned to their ocean environment and also to their agricultural lifestyle</li>
          <li>The images of Polynesian deities and the stories of their exploits are therefore also closely aligned to these aqua and agricultural environments.</li>
          <li>Many of the gods are depicted in elements of the environment and accordingly their exploits determine important aspects of human interaction with the environment.</li>
          <li>The traditions of the gods have significant impact on the daily life of Polynesian communities through their interaction with the environment</li>
          <li>Examples of this interaction can be readily seen in the practices undertaken to ensure the favourable disposition of gods which will determine the fertility of the land.</li> 
          <li>Polynesian communities learn seek to live in harmony with the divine forces in their natural world and ensure their own happiness and well being.</li>
          <li>Elements in the stories of their ancestor heroes provide an ethical framework for life</li>  
          <li>Ethical demands are distilled from reflection on various elements of an oral tradition which tells of the liberating exploits of ancestor heroes.</li>
