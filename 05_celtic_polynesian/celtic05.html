		<h2>Influence of religion on society</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>Separate cults</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The extent of the influence of religion on Celtic society is difficult to determine. Overtime practices that had their roots in earlier more primitive times became more <strong>symbolic</strong> in nature and were passed on through stories, poetry, prayers and song and in remembered rituals, customs and festival celebrations.</p>
		    <p>Religion for the earliest Celts was of the life manifested in nature. Men and women probably had 
			  separate cults, and, of the two, perhaps that of the latter is more important. As hunters, men 
			  worshipped the animals they slew, apologising to them for the slaughter. This <strong>apologetic attitude</strong>, 
			  found with all primitive hunters, is of the nature of a cult. Other animals, too sacred to be slain,
			   would be preserved and worshipped, the cult giving rise to <strong>domestication</strong> and <strong>pastoral life</strong>, with 
			   <strong>totemism</strong> as a probable factor. Earth, producing vegetation, was the fruitful mother; but since the 
			   origin of agriculture is mainly due to women, the <strong>Earth cult</strong> would be practised by them, as well 
			   as, later, that of vegetation and corn spirits, all regarded as female. As men began to interest 
			   themselves in agriculture, they would join in the female cults, probably with the result of 
			   changing the sex of the spirits worshipped. An <strong>Earth-god</strong> would take the place of the <strong>Earth-mother</strong>, 
			   or stand as her consort or son.   Popular superstitions and magical observances, including human 
			   sacrifice varied from place to place. Local features were seen as <strong>embodiments</strong> or vehicles of divine 
			   or of a <strong>diabolic power</strong>. Central to their worship was the <strong>deification</strong> of the sun as an emblem of 
			   divine power and constancy. There was the worship of personified deities such as <strong>Lugh</strong> conceived 
			   as representing natural forces as guardians of social laws.</p>

          <div class="footnote"><p>Knowledge about natural phenomena</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The <strong>Romans</strong> were impressed by the body of teaching of a quasi-scientific nature about <strong>natural phenomena</strong> and the constitution of the universe. Unfortunately there is very little known about the knowledge that the Druids kept. The <strong>megalithic people</strong> had <strong>special doctrines</strong>, rituals and the <strong>sacerdotal organisation</strong> of  Druidism but the meaning for the people of the time and the influence that this had on the everyday lives of Celtic peoples is <strong>speculative</strong> and prone to <strong>theory</strong> and <strong>conjecture</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Importance of the number 3</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>There is archaeological evidence that the number three was a powerful organising tool for spiritual and social and many other concepts in Celtic life. There were three classes of people - <strong>elite specialists</strong>, <strong>common herders</strong>, and <strong>slaves</strong>. There were three main classes of gods - those requiring sacrifices by fire, those by taking breath and blood and those requiring sacrifices by water. The concept of "threeness" is seen in a major artistic motif - <strong>the treskele</strong>, in which a circle is divided into three pulsing and swirling and, only approximately, equal parts.</p>
		    <p>Yet from these fragments we see the Celts as seekers after God, linking themselves by strong ties to the unseen, and eager to conquer the unknown by religious rite or magic art. Things of the spirit have had a strong appeal to the Celtic soul, and long ago <strong>classical observers</strong> were struck with the religiosity of the Celts. They neither forgot nor <strong>transgressed</strong> the law of the gods, and they thought that no good befell men apart from their will.</p>
