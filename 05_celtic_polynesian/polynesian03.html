		<h1>Content Description</h1>
		<h2>The role of the supernatural powers and deities in the religion</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>Patrons of labour an cultural activities</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The major gods of Polynesian societies are usually <strong>personifications</strong> of an aspect of nature and <strong>patrons</strong> of labour and cultural activities. These general functions are fairly common between islands and groups though their specific functions and positions vary.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Male and female images</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The <strong>vast majority</strong> of the recognised gods are <strong>male</strong>. These  gods are known variously as Kanaloa, Ta'aroa, Tanoa, Tangaloa, Tangaroa, Kane, Tane, Ku, Tu, Lono, Oro, Rongo, Roo. Despite the numerical dominance of the male gods, <strong>the principle of the female god</strong> is powerfully evident through <strong>Papa the Earth Mother</strong> and the first woman Ina, Hina or Sina who is often personified in the moon.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Natural elements</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>Given their close <strong>association with natural elements</strong> and their personification in nature it is not surprising that the main activities of the gods in Polynesian societies are associated with the natural elements. Polynesians see the <strong>activity of these gods in natural occurrences</strong> which either positively or negatively affect their existence. The fair weather that leads to a peaceful life and a fertile harvest is seen as the work of the gods as is the destruction caused by cyclone or a period of drought.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Neither benevolent or malevolent</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The gods are not seen characteristically as being either benevolent or malevolent. Essentially they are <strong>good natured and not evil</strong>, however, they are regularly <strong>engaged in their own affairs</strong> which tend to <strong>spill over into human activities</strong>. Thus the tears of longing for a lover on the part of one god may bring refreshing rain to the earth, yet a dispute between two supernatural brothers may lead to a devastating cyclone or tsunami </p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Procreation with human partners</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>A common feature of the supernatural beings in Polynesian mythology is their <strong>propensity to procreate with human partners</strong> bringing to birth <strong>semi divine heroes</strong> who feature in many stories and have a very significant role in the social structure and ethical requirements of Polynesian societies. These <strong>heroes such as Maui and Tawhaki</strong> have had their talents and exploits enshrined in legend. They are seen as humans possessing <strong>extraordinary spiritual power</strong>, generally known as <strong>mana</strong>, and therefore superhuman ability. These heroes are regarded as the <strong>ancestors of modern day human beings</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Overcoming tyranny</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>An important element of these heroic ancestral figures is their role in <strong>overcoming tyranny and oppression</strong>. They are frequently portrayed and <strong>using their supernatural powers to liberate people</strong> from oppressive situations and their actions are seen as an allegory for the actions required of human beings today. A great deal of the accepted <strong>ethical requirements</strong> of life in Polynesian societies can be seen to <strong>derive from the actions of these heroes</strong> such as Maui and Tawhaki.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Maui cycle</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>In the Maui cycle of stories he is depicted, among other things, as <strong>bringing fire</strong> to the earth to allow people to cook their food, <strong>raising the sky</strong> to enable people to walk in an upright manner and <strong>slowing the movement of the sun</strong> to allow enough time each day for people to attend to their work and still have time for leisure.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Quality of human life</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>These actions are all examples of <strong>using the supernatural power</strong> to <strong>improve the quality of human life</strong> and as Maui is regarded as an ancestor of human beings, his actions provide an <strong>ethical standard</strong> by which human activity and interaction can be regulated.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Descendents of ancestral heroes</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>A further consequence of the union of the gods with human partners is the existence in modern society of <strong>descendents</strong> of the offspring of these unions. Such descendents are <strong>highly respected</strong> and their existence forms the <strong>basis for the stratification of Polynesian societies into classes of people</strong>. Those who hold titles descended from ancestral heroes are regarded as <strong>royalty or nobility</strong> and others in the society are <strong>commoners</strong> who have an obligation to respect these noble classes and serve them. In return the descendents of the ancestral heroes have a moral obligation to provide for the wellbeing of their subjects.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Tu'i Tonga</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>A prominent example of a modern day ancestor of such heroes is the <strong>King of Tonga</strong> who is regarded as the <strong>descendent of the Tu'i Tonga</strong>.  The tradition of the Tu'i Tonga is important in understanding how a society such as Tonga is structured with the royal family and various classes of nobles holding enormous power in the community.</p>
		    <p>The title of Tu'i Tonga is traced back to the sexual liaison between the god Tangaloa and the woman 'Ilaheva. The tradition of the origins of the title of Tu'i Tonga is as follows.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Story of the origins of the Tu'i Tonga</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>There was a <strong>chief from Niue</strong> who wanted his <strong>daughter, 'Ilaheva</strong> to marry a Tongan. He commanded his servants to take his daughter to Tonga, so they departed to Tonga in a canoe. When they passed Vava'u she didn't want to stay there because <strong>Vava'u was too mountainous</strong>. When they reached Ha'apai she did not like it either because there is a <strong>volcano in Ha'apai</strong> and she was scared of it. When they <strong>reached Tongatapu</strong> the servants left her on a beach and returned to Niue.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Tangaloa and 'Ilaheva</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>This woman <strong>lived near Popua</strong> in the bush. Sometimes the people of Popua saw her in the distance and so they named her 'Ilaheva Va'epopua, which means, 'Ilaheva-who-lives-near-Popua. There was a <strong>god in the sky named Tangaloa</strong> 'Eitumatupua who also saw this woman. He came down to earth and made friends with her. <strong>Out of this relationship she became pregnant</strong>. After she became pregnant Tangaloa stopped coming to see her because he already had a family in the sky. In time this woman <strong>gave birth to a boy that she named 'Aho'eitu</strong>. Although his father, Tangaloa, lived in the sky, he still took care of 'Aho'eitu and his mother because he dropped down some clay from the sky so that 'Aho'eitu would have good dirt to grow food.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>'Aho'eitu and Tangaloa</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p><strong>When 'Aho'eitu had grown to be a man</strong> he asked his mother to tell him where he could find his father. She pointed to a certain tree and told him that if he would climb the tree then he would see a path that goes through the sky. <strong>'Aho'eitu climbed the tree</strong>, saw the path in the sky and then went along the path. He soon came to a plantation where his father was working. He stopped and talked and those two soon <strong>realised that they were father and son</strong>, so they were very happy to meet one another. </p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>'Aho'eiu's brothers</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The father, Tangaloa, told 'Aho'eitu to go further and he would come to some people playing games near a hill. 'Aho'eitu was told that he would find his five half-brothers near the hill. <strong>So 'Aho'eitu went on and found his brothers</strong>. When 'Aho'eitu approached the hill, he was introduced to the people as being the son of Tangaloa. 'Aho'eitu's brothers were <strong>jealous of him because he was so handsome</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Murder of 'Aho'eitu</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>So they took him away secretly, <strong>chopped off his head and threw it underneath a hoi bush</strong>. Since then the hoi bush is poisonous. Then they <strong>roasted 'Aho'eitu and ate him</strong>. Their father returned from the plantation and asked his sons if they had seen their brother. They denied having seen him. But their <strong>father could tell that they had eaten their brother</strong>. So the father took a kumete (a large wooden bowl) and placed it in front of his sons and told them to tickle their throats so that they vomited into the kumete. Then they took the head of 'Aho'eitu and put it into the kumete and covered the kumete with a mat. They placed the kumete behind the house. Through the evening they kept returning to the bowl and looking underneath the mat. They could see that <strong>the body of their brother was taking shape from the vomit in the bowl</strong>. The next morning they looked under the mat and their brother had come back to life in the kumete.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>'Aho'eitu's returns to Tonga</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>At this point 'Aho'eitu wanted to go back down to Tonga. His brothers felt sorry that they had eaten their brother, so they asked their father if they could go down to Tonga with 'Aho'eitu. The father agreed. But <strong>he told his sons</strong> that because they had eaten their brother, that <strong>they and their descendants would have to serve 'Aho'eitu</strong>. The descendants of the older brother have become the Tu'ipelehake chiefs and the four other brothers became the falefa, that is, the four houses. When the king of Tonga has a kava drinking ceremony or a funeral, they organise it. These words are done. </p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Origins the royal dynasty</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>This story conveys the <strong>origins of the royal dynasty</strong> an also the <strong>structure of the nobility</strong> in Tongan society. It also teaches the Tongans of common descent that their King and their nobles are <strong>descendents of the god Tangaloa</strong>. Accordingly they are to be reverenced and respected in Tongan society.</p>

		<h2>The relationship between sacred spaces and the beliefs of the religion</h2>
		<div class="content2">		
          <div class="footnote"><p>Sacred spaces</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>In traditional Polynesian societies tribal life was centered around an area of <strong>sacred space</strong> known variously as <strong>heiau or malae or  marae or me'ae</strong>. This space is usually prominently located and is generally a <strong>simple open-air area marked out by stones</strong>. In some cases it may include a <strong>shrine or altar</strong> area where offerings were made. There may also be an <strong>image of a god</strong> usually carved from wood or sculpted from stone.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Rituals</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>In this are various rituals could be carried out involving <strong>song, dance, chanting of sacred formulae and the drinking of kava</strong>. In addition to the ritual elements indicated here, the sacred space could also serve as a community meeting place and in particular as a <strong>place of discussion</strong> and decision making for <strong>community elders</strong>. The ritual elements carried out in the me'ae are intended to provide a means of ensuring the <strong>safe ordering of society</strong> and to avoid causing offence to any of the spirits.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Ethical codes</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>The <strong>communal discussion and decision making</strong> dimensions are intended to ensure appropriate <strong>adherence to ethical codes</strong> within the society.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Priestly sanctuary</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text"><p>In Tongan society a number of <strong>sacred houses</strong> exist for <strong>different purposes</strong>. One serves as a <strong>priestly sanctuary</strong>. Traditionally this is where the priest would seek to know what is required by the gods. It would also be a <strong>place of prayer and offerings</strong>. The sacred house also served as a <strong>sanctuary for exiles</strong>. Women and children could also take <strong>shelter there in times of war</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Nobles' tombs and meeting houses</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Another type of sacred house existed as a <strong>shelter to the tomb of local nobility</strong>. This shelter had the dual role of providing <strong>shelter from the elements</strong> for the tomb and also a <strong>place of prayer and recollection</strong> for members of the deceased's family.</p>
		    <p>Another important site in Tongan society was the meeting place known as <strong>Fale Fakataha</strong> . This house would normally have <strong>a tiered structure where people could be seated according to their status</strong>. It would be used for <strong>ceremonial kava drinking</strong> as well as <strong>community meetings</strong> and any other important village gatherings.</p>
