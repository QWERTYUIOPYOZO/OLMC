			<h1>Content Description</h1>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p /></div>
		<div class="text">			
		  <p>Throughout human history religion has played an important role, both on
		    a personal and a societal level. On a personal level, religion provides
		    meaning and purpose for an individual person's life. On a larger
		    scale, the religious dimension in human history has been twofold: on the
		    one hand it has assisted to bind society together by affirming entrenched
		    traditions. On the other hand religion has also provided counter-cultural
		    criticism regarding the inequality created by the status quo. Thus, it
		    can be said that the role of the religious dimension in human history,
		    at least on a societal level, has been a paradoxical one.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>Meaning and purpose for the individual </h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Key religious questions</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Human experience is characterised by a search for understanding of the
		    great questions. These great questions of meaning are also known
		    as the <b>key
		    religious questions</b>. The most significant of these fundamental
		    religious questions are those concerned with the <b>origin, purpose
		    and destiny of humankind</b>. These questions can be phrased as where
		    do we come from or, what is the origin of creation? Why are we here
		    or, what is the purpose of human existence? And what happens to us when
		    we die or, what is the destiny of human beings? These are not the only
		    such questions but they are the most significant. Religion attempts to
		    set down guidelines, which answer these key religious questions and in
		    doing so attempts to impose some form of coherence and order to life. However,
	      religion often does not provide straightforward answers to these questions.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Religion provides certainty in an ever changing world</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>One important function of religion is to provide a sense of <b>consistency
and certainty to life in a world that appears to be ever changing</b>. The
belief in the existence of a higher being, of a being that controls and watches
over humanity allows human beings to impose onto their lives, a <b>framework
of meaning</b>, which gives human existence a sense of direction. The way
in which religion provides meaning to life is particularly <b>uplifting
during times of crises</b>, brought about by events such as the death of
a close friend or family member, the breakdown of long term relationships, illness
and unemployment where human knowledge can no longer provide satisfactory answers
to life's big questions.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Religion offers a sense of belonging within a community for individuals</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Another important function of religion is to provide individuals with
		    a <b>sense of belonging within a community</b>. Human beings
		    are, by nature, communal creatures who strive to find a sense of
		    belonging within society. Consequently, the development of the ritualistic
		    dimension of religion, such as the practice of prescribed rituals and the
		    partaking of communal worship within religious traditions, helps to provide
	      individuals with a sense of belonging to a community.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">
		  <p> Role of ritual practice</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> Ritual practice</b> not only strengthens the
		    individual's
            relationship with a divine being or ultimate reality, but it also
            renews an individual's bonds with a community of believers.
            This sense of belonging is particularly important, when membership
            consists of small ethnic minorities or groups that are socially marginalised
            or alienated from mainstream society. Thus, <b>religion also
            plays a significant role in reinforcing the cultural identity of
          a group</b>.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">
		  <p> Theory of religion as a projection of fundamental
	      human needs</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Given the role of religion in fulfilling fundamental human needs, it
		    is not surprising to find theories which propose the idea that religion
		    is a social construct, a myth fabricated by human beings to meet
		    human needs. One such theory is given by Ludwig Feuerbach, a nineteenth
		    century German philosopher who argued that religion originated not
		    from an examination of evidence which pointed to the existence of
		    a divine being but as a projection of the deepest desires and wishes of
		    humankind.</p>
		  <p>Feuerbach's
		    reasoning was that given the natural vulnerability of human kind, religion
		    probably developed as a result of the human need to believe in the existence
		    of a nurturing, higher being that will protect them.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Social cohesion</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p> Religion reinforces traditional beliefs and practices </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The idea that religion is a force social cohesion acknowledges the core
		    role of religion in affirming and <b>reinforcing traditional beliefs,
		    practices and social customs</b>. This function of religion in strengthening
		    the traditional bonds of society can be regarded as being both a
	      negative and a positive force.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">
		  <p> Positive effects of religion as a force of social
	      cohesion</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>On the positive side, <b>religion can provide communities with a
		      sense of continuity and certainty in an uncertain and confusing world</b>.
		      For example, immigrants can turn to their religion as a source of continuity
		      from the world they have just left behind. Another positive role of religion,
		      which is inherently conservative, is that it provides modern society
		      with a sense of stability and clarity in a world that is becomingly increasingly
	      complex and rapidly changing.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Negative effects of religion as a force of social
		    cohesion </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b> On the negative side, since religion is inherently
		    conservative in many ways, it also serves to reinforce values and
		    traditions which may be unjust. For example, throughout history <b>religion
		    has been used as a means of authorising the legitimacy of unjust institutions</b> such
	      as slavery and the oppression of women.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Social transformation</h2>
		<div class="footnote">
		  <p> Paradoxical role of religion in history</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b>The great <b>paradox</b> with religion is
		    that whilst it can be used to uphold and preserve traditional institutions,
		    values and practices, religion can also be used as a tool for social transformation
	      which criticises the very structures, customs, and beliefs of its own societies.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote">
		  <p> Religion and social justice</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b> Religious groups have a long tradition of campaigning<b></b>for<b> social
		    justice, equality, </b>and advocating the rights of groups that have
		    been<b> marginalised </b>by mainstream society. For example,
		    religious groups are often at the forefront of campaigns which seek
		    to address issues such as poverty, environmental degradation, global conflict,
		    economic inequality, indigenous rights and unemployment. These values
		    of equality, peace, justice and tolerance are derived from the sacred writings
		    of the religious traditions and from the stories of founders and
		    significant leaders of the traditions.</p>
		  <p>The importance of working towards a just and peaceful society
		      is integral to the message of all major religious traditions and
		    as such these groups are regularly seen working in areas leading towards
		    social transformation. </p>
