		<h1>Content Description</h1>
		<div class="content2"><h2>The rise of Materialism</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p> Increasingly materialistic nature of society </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> There seems to be close correlation between the rise of materialism,
		    particularly in the western world and the growth in new religious
		    expressions. It is evident that the <b>abundant wealth and prosperity</b> advertised
		    and promoted in a materialist society creates in individuals a strong
	      desire to gain a significant share in this wealth.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Some new age religions attest to being a means of
		    gaining wealth </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>This desire can also be accompanied by a <b>wish to gain wealth
		      and prosperity quickly and without great effort on the part of
		      the individual</b>.
		    As a consequence of these desires, many people are attracted to philosophies
		    and approaches which claim to facilitate a quick and certain accumulation
		    of wealth for those who follow it.</p>
		  <p>A number of new religious expressions
		      advocate ways of achieving individual wealth and prosperity and
		    appeal very strongly to many individuals in materialist societies. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Cult of individualism </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>A second factor related to the growth of materialism is what is often
		    referred to as the <b>cult of individualism</b>. Materialism
		    often <b>encourages
individuals to seek their own fulfilment and satisfaction without regard for
others</b>. Many examples of new religious expression are characterised
by their claim to achieve personal fulfilment and wellbeing. There is, therefore,
a clear and strong link between the aims of materialism and the claims of many
new religious expressions.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Personal wellbeing offered as a commodity

</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> A third aspect of the relationship between the rise of materialism and
		    the growth in new religious expressions is the ethos of <b>consumerism</b>.
		    Consumerism effectively claims that <b>personal fulfilment, happiness
		    and wellbeing can be "purchased" as a kind of commodity</b>.
		    Such claims are particularly evident in media advertising. The notion
		    of depicting fulfilment and wellbeing as commodities which can be purchased
		    provides an environment where individuals will use their material
		    wealth to try and buy the things that will make them happy. In this environment,
		    programs, philosophies and practices which purport to provide this
		    fulfilment and wellbeing are commodities which can be bought and sold.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>Scientific progress</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p /></div>
		<div class="text">		
		<p>The impact of scientific progress on the growth in new religious expressions is directly related to the effect of scientific progress on the status and authority of traditional religious beliefs and practices.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Science can undermine faith in traditional religious institutions</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>  In many situations, new religious expressions are taken up by people
		    who feel that traditional religious beliefs and practices have not fulfilled
		    a particular role or met a particular need. When scientific progress has
		    the effect of undermining or reducing the authority of religious traditions
		    then it is inevitable that some people will go in search of other religious
	      expressions to meet their needs.</p>
		  <p> The place of religion in providing explanation for matters of concern
		    to humankind has been significantly affected by progress in the field of
		    the sciences. Increasingly <b>science has achieved developments which
		    raise questions about the worldview of traditional religious understanding</b>.</p>
		  <p> While this tension between religious understanding and scientific discovery
		    is not a new one, recent decades have seen rapid growth in scientific knowledge
		    and discoveries in fields which have raised serious questions for some
		    religious perspectives.</p>
		  Not all scientific discoveries provide such challenges, however, recent
		  decades have seen work done in areas which seem to directly challenge and
		  confront traditional religious perspectives. </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Examples of how science can challenge religion </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Developments in the field of genetics has called into question the
		    role of a divine creator in light of the capability of cloning different
		    species. Discoveries drawn from space exploration have raised new
	      questions about the origins and development of our solar system.</p>
		  <p>While many
		      people holding religious beliefs will not be overly concerned by
		    such developments, for others they raise significant challenges. In particular
		    there are two types of people who are likely to be affected by these challenges
		    in a way which may cause them to abandon traditional religious beliefs. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>A simplistic understanding of religious truth can lead to loss of faith</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Some people who have an <b>unsophisticated understanding of the relationship
between religious truth and scientific truth</b> are likely to find discoveries
of this type to be confirmation of the failure of religion in this area. As a
consequence, some are likely to <b>abandon traditional religious beliefs</b> and
practices, believing them to be discredited by scientific discoveries.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Fundamentalist understandings of religious truths
		    can lead to loss of faith </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> A second group who are likely to be affected are those who hold literal
		    or <b>fundamentalist understandings of religion.</b> Such people
		    may be devastated by the impact of discoveries which seem to disprove
		    matters which they had regarded as utterly reliable on the basis of their
		    biblical authority.<b> To have such things overturned by scientific
		    discoveries may lead to a loss of faith </b>and sense of disillusionment
		    on the part of such people.</p>
		  <p>Thus, scientific progress can challenge the religious
		      perspectives of some people and as a consequence of their disillusionment
		      they may begin seeking answers in other areas. New expressions
		    of religion provide many attractive options to people in such situations
		    and it is likely that scientific progress has indeed had the effect of
		    causing disillusionment in some people which ultimately leads them into
		    taking up alternatives to their traditional religious beliefs. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Many new age religions have a pseudo-scientific basis </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> <b> </b> While scientific progress can have the role of challenging and
		    confronting some aspects of religious belief, it can and does also provide
		    a new avenue of religious expression. <b>Many examples of new expressions
		    of religion have a pseudo-scientific basis</b>. Some claim to provide
		    healing, fulfilment, wellbeing etc through harnessing of the power
		    drawn from some aspect of scientific progress.</p>
		  <p>Such pseudo-scientific approaches can have considerable
		      appeal to some people. The <b>association with science provides them with a degree of authenticity</b> which
    many people find reassuring. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Growth of ecological awareness</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Closeness to the environment can be a healing thing </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> <b> </b>Many examples of new religious expression have close connections
		    with the environment. As such they are particularly <b>attractive
		    to people who feel that closeness to the environment is a fulfilling and/or
	      healing thing</b>.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>New age religions adapt animistic and ancient nature religions</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> <b> </b> A number of these new religious expressions are a<b>daptations
		      of animistic perspectives</b> and <b>ancient nature religions</b>.
		      They seek to recapture elements of universal power which they believe
		      are available through the natural environment. These might include rituals
		      to connect to spiritual elements of the environment or possibly the use
		      of natural elements in some therapeutic or medicinal way.
		  </p>
		  <p> The growth of ecological awareness in recent generations has made a significant
  contribution to the awareness of the beauty and sanctity of creation as well
  as its power and fragility. With this growing awareness there is an opportunity
  for people to become attracted to the types of new religious expression which
  have close connections to ecological concerns.</p>
Some new religious expressions and spiritualities make use of the connection
between the human person and their natural environment as a source of healing
and personal enrichment. These may include nature retreats, rituals involving
elements of nature and prayers invoking a power or spirit from within creation. </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Adoption of nature's inherent wisdom by new age religions</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Other forms of new religious expression focus more on a study
		    of ecology to learn ways of living in harmony with the environment and
		    responsibly using the healing and therapeutic elements of the earth to
		    provide for the needs of human beings. These examples do not seek the intervention
		    of an earth spirit but rather belief that there is a <b>traditional
		    wisdom within the environment</b> which
can be beneficial to humankind if studied and explored.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Disenchantment with traditional religious practice and guidance</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Key reason for the growth of new age religions</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> It is far from coincidental that the growth in new religious expressions
		    and spiritualities is occurring at a time when there is a steady
		    decline in the numbers of people who are following traditional religious
		    practices. In many cases the <b>disenchantment with traditional religious
		    practice and guidance is the primary reason for an individual seeking fulfilment
	      in other religious practices</b>.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Traditional religious support is often seen as meaningless</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Many people have simply found that <b>traditional religious practices
		      do not provide a relevant and meaningful support</b> for them in
		      the challenges they face in the modern world. Such people often find
		      the rituals of these traditions to be detached from the concerns of their
		      daily lives, they also find the guidance on moral and ethical issues
	      to be harsh and unreasonable.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Decline in the authority of religious leaders</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>In addition to the question of relevance, there has also been a serious <b>loss
	      of confidence in the authority of religious leaders</b> and representatives. This is partly due to a perception that their leadership is out of touch with the concerns of the modern world and partly due to a serious breach in trust resulting from various instances of abuse which have come to light in recent decades.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>It is socially acceptable not to follow a traditional religious belief</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Finally, the increasing secularism in western societies such as Australia
		    means that there is <b>no social imperative for a person to follow
		    a traditional religious belief</b>. There is no sanction, moral or
		    otherwise, against a person who chooses not to adopt a religious belief
		    and there is no social or cultural pressure for a person to conform to
	      religious standards or practices. </p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Many still hold religious beliefs of some form</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Given the extent of the grounds for disenchantment with traditional
		  religious practices it is hardly surprising to note that only a <b>small
		  percentage of Australians regularly attend religious services</b> and
		  even fewer use religious authority and teaching as a primary source
		  of ethical guidance.		  </p>
		  <p> Although approximately 75% of the Australian population are nominally Christian,
  statistics on Church attendance show that between 10 and 20% or these nominal
  Christians attend Church services regularly. Overall it would be very optimistic
  to claim that one in five Australians are regular in their practice of traditional
  religion and/or rely on religious authority and teaching to guide their moral
  and ethical decisions.</p>
<p> Despite the relatively small numbers who regularly take part in religious
  services, there are apparently <b>many Australians </b>who<b> hold
  religious beliefs </b>such as believing in a divine being, believing in
  some type of afterlife or rebirth and believing that there is a divine purpose
  or plan for human beings. Some studies have shown that up to 90% of Australians
  hold such religious beliefs yet many of these do not identify with the traditional
  religious practices available to them.</p>
<p> The reality of the disenchantment with traditional religious practice and
  guidance and the decline in the numbers of people who are following these religious
  practices provides an interesting juxtaposition with the relatively high percentage
  of the population who espouse some type of religious faith or belief.</p>
In this environment, it is not surprising that many who have become disenchanted
with traditional religious beliefs and guidance are being attracted to the range
of new religious expressions and spiritualities. The breadth of options available,
the focus on personal fulfilment, the absence of authorities and structures and
the appeal of the exotic are among a number of reasons that those disenchanted
with mainstream religions may be attracted to new religious expressions and spiritualities.</div>
