		<div class="footnote"><p>Increasing popularity of new age religions</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Alongside the traditional religious practices and worldviews which take
		    a non religious perspective, there are an increasing number of religious
		    expressions which are often referred to as <b> new age religions</b> or
		    new age spiritualities. These new religious expressions are appealing to
		    a wide spectrum of Australian society and seem to attract people for a
	      variety of reasons.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Diverse nature of new age religions</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> There is no simple way of identifying or classifying those approaches
		    which are known as new religious expressions. They are <b>very diverse</b> and
	      often particularised to small groups or individual approaches.</p>
		  <p> Some new religious expressions are based on perceived wisdom or insight
		    drawn from aspects of <b>ancient religious belief</b>, others
		    are based on a kind of <b>psychological framework of unlocking human
		    potential</b> while still others are based on <b>pseudo-scientific
		    approaches to health and wellbeing</b>.</p>
		  It would be possible to draw up an extremely long list of examples
		  of new religious expressions. The following short list provides an indication
		  of the type of practices and philosophies involved. </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Examples of new age religions</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>  Examples of new religious expressions include <b> astrology</b>, <b> crystals</b>, <b>feng
		      shui</b>, <b>magnetic field therapy</b>, <b> numerology</b>, <b>palmistry</b>,
		      spiritual healing, <b> tai chi</b>, <b> tarot cards</b>, <b> transcendental
	      meditation</b> and <b> yoga</b>.</p>
		  Some people adopt new religious expressions in a serious and devout
		  manner, others take a passing or occasional interest in these practices.
		  Some people rely heavily on such practices and beliefs while others continue
		  to follow traditional religious beliefs while taking up aspects of new religious
		  expressions as well. </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Characteristics of new age religions </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>New religious expressions are most <b>often focused on the particular
		    needs of the individual </b>and many seek to provide a sense of personal
		    fulfilment and wellbeing. There is<b> usually no structure</b> or
		    hierarchy associated with new religious expressions and there is
		    usually no particular commitment required. These new religious expressions
		    generally do not have any doctrine of social renewal beyond the needs
		    of the individual and usually do not require any action in the service
		    of others.</p>
		  <p>People
		      are attracted to new religious expressions and spiritualities for
		    a wide range of reasons, three significant reasons are: the search
		    for personal fulfilment, the need for ethical guidance and the desire to
		    belong to and understand their relationship with society. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Search for personal fulfilment</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Importance of search for personal fulfilment </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The search for personal fulfilment is almost certainly the <b>most
		      significant attraction of new religious expressions</b> and spiritualities.
		      In an environment where increased <b> secularism</b> has resulted
		      in an absence of <b>meaningful life</b> experience and where <b>traditional
		      religious beliefs are often regarded as irrelevant</b> there is
		      a strong need for people to find meaning and purpose in life's
	      journey.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Diverse nature of new age religions</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Many examples of new religious expressions and spiritualities appeal
		    directly to the need for personal fulfilment. In fact they have this
		    as their ultimate goal. This <b>personal fulfilment is offered in
		    a considerable variety of ways</b> from being successful in a career
		    and having considerable personal wealth and resources to being happy
		    in relationships as well as being physically and emotionally well.  </p>
		  <p>The breadth of opportunities offered in the range of new religious expressions
    will appeal to many who a searching for meaning in life and looking for ways
    to feel more fulfilled and at home with themselves. They offer a means of
		    achieving fulfilment and wellbeing which is an important need in
		    any community.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Seeking ethical guidelines</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p> Lack of moral certainty in a secular society </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Another effect of a <b>secular and materialist society</b> is
		    the notion of <b>moral relativism </b>where everything seems
		    to become a matter of personal choice and where there is an <b>absence
	      of moral certainty</b> or absolute moral truth.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Traditional religious guidance is often seen as irrelevant &amp; meaningless</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>This sense of moral relativism is further heightened by the diminished
		  role of traditional religions in providing moral guidance. While religious
		  traditions still provide guidance, it is seen by many to be meaningless
		    and irrelevant. As a consequence, people find themselves in an environment
		    where there is very little moral or ethical guidance and where they must
		    make their own decisions on ethical issues.		  </p>
		  <p> Many people find the responsibility of <b>formulating their
              own ethical guidelines to be problematic</b> and onerous.
              They find it difficult to work their way through complex moral
              problems and feel uncertain about the appropriate actions to take
              or avoid.</p>
          In this situation some find support through the approaches of some
          new religious expressions which incorporate either an ethical code
          or a simple mechanism to determine ethical guidelines. Such new religious
          expressions appeal to those who feel the need to find ethical guidance. </div>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Seek to clarify their relationship with society </h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p /></div>
		<div class="text">		
		<p>While individualism is a common focus of new religious expressions and spiritualities, some do include communal dimensions and ways of understanding the place of the individual in society.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Modern society is becoming less community oriented </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> <b> Human beings are essentially social creatures </b> and
		    few people will live happily without meaningful contact with others
		    and a meaningful place in a community or society. <b>Many aspects
		    of modern societies work against the development of these relationships</b> and
	      as a consequence some people feel isolated and alienated from society.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Cult of individualism

</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> <b> </b> The <b>emphasis on individualism </b>in
		    western societies and the failure of religious communities to provide a
		    meaningful and relevant experience of community has left a void that may
		    be filled for some through an involvement with new religious expressions
		    or spiritualities.</p>
		  <p>There are
		      many possible explanations for the growth of new religious expressions.
		    Four of the most significant factors are the rise of materialism,
		    scientific progress, growth of ecological awareness and disenchantment
		    with traditional religious practice and guidance.</p>
