            <p><b> Using examples, explain the meaning of the terms animism,
                polytheism and monotheism. (5 marks) </b><b> - 150
            words</b></p>
	        <p> Animism is the doctrine that all natural things have souls. For
	          example, many prehistoric hunter-gatherer communities believed that
	          all natural objects from animals to hailstorms, to rivers and mountains
	          had a soul. This soul was believed to control the activities of both
	          animate and inanimate objects. These spirits or souls were revered
	          because of their control over the natural world.</p>
	        <p> Polytheism is the belief and worship of multiple divinities. For
	          example, the texts of classical antiquity such as the Iliad and the
	          Odyssey is a record of the power struggles which took place, the
	          hierarchical nature of the Greek cosmic world, and the personalities
	          and idiosyncrasies of the Greek gods. Unlike the God of the Judaic-Christian
	          tradition, the polytheistic gods of the Norse, Egyptian, Graeco-Roman
	          and Chinese cultures were rarely all powerful and all knowing. Rather
	          they had their own particular skills and talents, and their own genealogy
	          and personalities. </p>
	        <p> Monotheism is the belief in the existence of one god, and one god
	          only. Hence, Islam, Judaism and Christianity can be described as monotheistic
	          religions. This singular god is usually depicted as being omnipotent,
	          omniscient and omnipresent. This high god is usually credited with
	          creating the world, and for giving humankind a moral code to follow.</p>
	        <p><b> Using examples, discuss how the religious dimension in human
	            history has contributed to social transformation. (5 marks) </b><b> - 150
	            words</b></p>
	        <p> History is evidence of the fact that religion can be used as a vehicle
	          for social transformation. In the past, religious groups have been
	          active on issues such as ecological sustainability, indigenous rights,
	          gender equality and economic inequality. The religious dimension of
	          human history has had a long history of counter-cultural criticism
	          of the inequalities created by the status quo. For example, traditionally
	          religious groups have advocated the reform of the economic structures
	          of society, in order to decrease the rates of poverty in society.
	          It should be remembered however, that whilst religion is a vehicle
	          of social transformation, religion is also often used as to reaffirm
	          and legitimize the very structures that it also criticises. Thus,
	          the paradox is, that the transformative role of religion in society
	          is to some extents, tempered by the fact that it also reinforces the
	          traditional institutions of society such as slavery and racial inequality.</p>
	        <p><b> Identify and account for the location of major Jewish communities
	            in the world today. (5 marks) </b><b> - 150 words</b></p>
	        <p> The 3 major global regions where significant numbers of Jews are
	          located are: the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East. The US and
	          Israel are the two largest centres of Jews in the world. Many Jews
	          are also located in Europe , in the countries of France , Britain
	          and Germany.</p>
	        <p> Many Jews are located in Europe as a result of the early Jewish
	          history of persecutions by groups such as the Romans, the Babylonians,
	          and the Assyrians who sent the Jews into exile. The 10 largest national
	          populations of Jews in the world are: (in ascending numerical order):
	          USA, Israel, France, Argentina, Palestine, Canada, Brazil, Britain,
	          Russia and Germany.</p>
	        <p>There are a significant number of Jews in the US because during the
	        20th century the US permitted a large number of Jews to migrate
	        there, and granted them American citizenship. The reason behind the
	        large number of Jews in Israel is that Judaism started in the ancient
	        land of Israel, which was known in the past, as the Promised Land
	        of Canaan. Following the genocide of Jews by Hitler's Nazi Party
	        in World War II the United Nations assisted to set up a Jewish homeland
	        in this ancient land of Canaan in 1948. The establishment of a Jewish
	        home state greatly assisted to increase the global population of
        Jews.</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
