        <div class="content2"><h2>Agnosticism</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Core beliefs of agnosticism </p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> <b> </b> Agnosticism is essentially a sceptical worldview, which awaits
		    more conclusive empirical evidence than that which is currently available,
		    before it choses to commit to the belief in the existence of a transcendent
		    reality. Thus, at the present time, agnostics argue that there is <b>insufficient
		    evidence to support the existence of a transcendent reality, though
		    this could conceivably change in the future</b>. Since agnostics,
		    at this point in time, do not believe that evidence to prove the existence
		    of god is sufficient, they do not entertain any idea of heaven, hell, judgement,
	      or any other idea directly related to the belief in a transcendent
	      being.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		 <div class="content2"><h2>Atheism</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p> Atheism is not an active belief system with its own
		    set of doctrines </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>It is difficult to pinpoint exactly how atheism as a worldview
		    shapes the aspirations and behaviours of individuals. This is because
		    atheism, unlike humanism, is <b>not an active philosophy with a body
		    of organised doctrines</b>.
		  Rather, atheism can be defined in the negative as the disbelief in
		    the notion of god or gods. Having said that however, it should be
		    remembered that humanists are atheists and hence atheism and humanism
		    are not two mutually exclusive philosophies.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>  
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Overlapping nature of atheism and humanism </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> Many of the beliefs and aspirations of humanism can also
            be applied to atheism</b>, however they are not exclusive to
            or particular to atheism, rather, they are characteristics of humanism
          that atheists may also possess. </p>
		  </div>
		</div>
	    <h2>Humanism</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Core beliefs of humanism </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Humanism is essentially a philosophy based on the premise that this world,
		    this life, and the morals, ethics and experiences gained from this
		    life are all we have. Human beings, therefore, are able to control their
		    own destiny. Since we can control our destinies and that of other people,
		    we should also try to better the lives of others. Consequently, humanism
		    has strong ethical and moral doctrines regarding social responsibility,
		    ecological sustainability, the belief that all human beings are born free
	      and equal. These are some of the core beliefs held by humanists.</p>

		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p> Amsterdam Declaration </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The <b>Amsterdam Declaration</b> of 2002 is the defining creed
		  of World Humanism. According to the Amsterdam Declaration the fundamental
		  tenets of humanism which determine the aspirations and behaviours of
		    individual humanists are as follows:		  </p>
		  <ol>
		    <li>
		      <p><b> Humanism is ethical.</b> It affirms the worth,
                dignity and autonomy of the individual and the right of every human
                being to the greatest possible freedom compatible with the rights
                of others. Humanists have a duty of care to all of humanity including
                future generations. Humanists believe that morality is an intrinsic
                part of human nature based on understanding and a concern for others,
                needing no external sanction. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p><b> Humanism is rational</b>. It seeks to use science
                  creatively, not destructively. Humanists believe that the solutions
                  to the world's problems lie in human thought and action rather
                  than divine intervention. Humanism advocates the application
		      of the methods of science and free inquiry to the problems of human
                  welfare. But Humanists also believe that the application of
		      science and technology must be tempered by human values. Science gives
                  us the means but human values must propose the ends. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p><b> Humanism supports democracy and human
                      rights</a>.</b> Humanism aims at the fullest possible
                      development of every human being. It holds that democracy
                      and human development are matters of right. The principles
                      of democracy and human rights can be applied to many human
                      relationships and are not restricted to methods of government. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p><b> Humanism insists that personal liberty must be combined
                    with social responsibility. </b> Humanism ventures to
                    build a world on the idea of the free person responsible
                    to society, and recognises our dependence on and responsibility
                    for the natural world. Humanism is undogmatic, imposing no
                    creed upon its adherents. It is thus committed to education
                    free from indoctrination. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p><b> Humanism is a response to the widespread demand for
                    an alternative to dogmatic religion. </b> The world's
                    major religions claim to be based on revelations fixed for
                    all time, and many seek to impose their world-views on all
                    of humanity. Humanism recognises that reliable knowledge
                    of the world and ourselves arises through a continuing process
                    of observation, evaluation and revision. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p><b> Humanism values artistic creativity and imagination</b> and
                  recognises the transforming power of art. Humanism affirms
		      the importance of literature, music, and the visual and performing
                  arts for personal development and fulfilment. </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		      <p><b> Humanism is a lifestance aiming at the maximum possible
                    fulfilment through the cultivation of ethical and creative living </b> and
                    offers an ethical and rational means of addressing the challenges
                    of our times. Humanism can be a way of life for everyone
                    everywhere </p>
