		<h1>Summary Points</h1>
		<h3> Students learn about:</h3>
		<p class="section_statement">The response of ONE religious and ONE non-religious belief system to:</p>
        <ul class="section_statement">
		  <li>The concept of the transcendent</li>
          <li>The human person</li>
          <li>Social responsibility</li>
	    </ul>
		<h3> Students learn to:</h3>
		<p class="section_statement">Compare the response of ONE religious and ONE non-religious belief system to:</p>
        <ul class="section_statement">
		  <li>The concept of the transcendent</li>
          <li>The human person</li>
          <li>Social responsibility</li>
	    </ul>
		<h3> The concept of the transcendent</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li> Christianity is based on the belief in God, a transcendent being
            who exists outside of and beyond the human </li>
          <li> Christians believe that God is the source of creation and it is
            God who gives meaning and purpose to life </li>
          <li> Humanists think that: this world and this life are all we have
            and hence reject the notion of the transcendent </li>
          <li> The acceptance/rejection of the belief in the transcendent has
            many implications </li>
          <li> Secular humanists believe that once a person had died their life
            has ended and there is no continuation of their life in any form </li>
          <li> This is in clear contrast to the Christian view which holds that
            beyond death there is an eternal life </li>
          <li> O ther aspects of C hristian views such as heaven and hell, judgement
            and so on are in contrast to humanist views which would not entertain
            the idea of any existence after death </li>
          <li> Some groups within Christianity do not accept scientific views
            of the origin of the universe (such as evolution) </li>
          <li> Most, however, have no difficulty accepting evolution as the mechanism
            of creation while retaining a belief in God as the source of creation </li>
          <li> Secular humanists accept only the scientific view of evolution
            without any reference to God or any religious dimension </li>
          <li> Secular humanists align themselves with some scientists who believe
            that creation was a spontaneous event without any motivation or cause </li>
	    </ul>
		<h3> The human person</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li> Humanists believe that human beings have thrived through their
            intelligent adaptation to the environment and their problem solving
            capabilities </li>
          <li> They regard the human person as being of supreme value, though
            with communal or social responsibilities </li>
          <li> Similar to humanists, Christians regard the human person as being
            of supreme value and that people also have certain responsibilities
            to one another </li>
          <li> Christians regard human beings to be bearers of the image and
            likeness of God </li>
          <li> Christians believe that s ocial and communal responsibilities
            are derived from the revelation of God </li>
          <li> Humanists on the other hand believe that the value of the human
            person and the accompanying responsibilities are derive d purely
            from human experience </li>
	    </ul>
		<h3> Social responsibility</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li> Both Christians and humanists hold strong views on social responsibility
            and community involvement </li>
          <li> Ultimately both groups believe it is important to contribute to
            making the world a better place and contributing to the overall quality
            of life of all people </li>
          <li> Most Christian groups have specific doctrines on s ocial r esponsibility </li>
          <li> Humanist ideas are similar though not as clearly defined </li>
          <li> Because humanism has no belief in an afterlife, there is a tendency
            to place greater emphasis on the contribution s made in this life </li>
          <li> Some Christian groups have been criticised for placing too much
            emphasis on the concerns of the afterlife and therefore neglecting
            the needs of people in this life </li>
          <li> Both Christianity and humanism hold a belief that material possessions
            are an acceptable adjunct to human life </li>
          <li> Both also regard the accumulation of excess as harmful, particularly
            in the face of the deprivation of others </li>
          <li> S ome Christian groups have specific doctrines on the ownership
            of property and the accompanying responsibilities in the face of
            the need of others </li>
          <li> Humanist ideas are similar though not as clearly defined </li>
          <li> There are distinct similarities between humanism and Christianity
            in their practical attitude towards ecological concerns </li>
          <li> Both regard the protection of the environment as critical </li>
          <li> Humanists and Christians are now significant contributors to ecological
            activism </li>
          <li> For Christians, the primary concern for environmental action is
            the relationship between the creator and the creation </li>
          <li> Christians regard human beings as being part of the creation of
            God and related to the rest of creation in a profound way </li>
          <li> Humanist regard human beings as being connected to and dependent
            upon the environment but do not hold the same sense of relationship
            with a creator </li>
	      <li>The humanist motivation is more centered on the idea
              that the earth is the environment of human beings and therefore
	        must be sustained in order for human life to continue</li>
