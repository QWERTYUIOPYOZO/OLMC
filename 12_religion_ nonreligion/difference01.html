		<h1>Content Description</h1>
		<h2>The concept of the transcendent</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>God created the world and gave meaning to life</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p><b> All Christians believe in the concept of the transcendent</b>,
		    which is the idea that there is something outside of and beyond the
		    human, and that it is this divine being which gives meaning and purpose
		    to life. Christianity, which is a monotheistic religion, has termed this
		    transcendent being, which exists, outside of and independent of the human,
		    God. <b>Christians
		    believe that God is the source of creation and that God gives meaning
	      and purpose to life</b>.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Humanists reject the notion of the transcendent</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p><b>Humanists</b> on the other
		    hand <b>do not accept the idea that there is an ultimate reality</b>,
		    or that there is something beyond the ordinary experiences of human
		    life. In fact, humanists have concluded, after an examination of evidence
	      regarding the existence of a transcendent being that such evidence is inconclusive.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Life after physical death </p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Thus, according to humanists, <b>this life and
		      this world is all we have</b>. The implications of this belief are
		      that humanists <b>reject
		    any ideas about life after physical death</b>. <b>Christians</b> on
		    the other hand, because of their belief in the existence of a higher
		    reality, a reality that exists outside of the human, <b>believe in
		    concepts such as heaven, hell, and judgement, as a part of their belief
		    in eternal life after death</b>.</p>
		  <p>Humanists, however, do not believe in the idea of life
		      after physical death and thus would not even begin to entertain
		    the notions of heaven, hell and judgement. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Source and mechanisms of creation</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>In a similar way, because humanists do not believe in the concept of
		  the transcendent, <b>humanists only accept the scientific view of evolution</b> without
		  any reference to God or to any other religious dimension.		  </p>
		  <p> Some fundamentalist groups within Christianity do not accept scientific views
  of the origin of the universe. <b>Most Christians</b> however, have
  no difficulty <b>accepting evolution as the mechanism of creation</b> while
  retaining a belief in <b>God as the source of creation</b>.</p>
Thus, for humanists and many Christians, there is no argument about the mechanics
of creation. The difference lies in what is believed to be behind this process.
Secular humanists align themselves with some scientists who believe that creation
was a spontaneous event without any motivation or cause. This is of course in
stark contrast to Christians who believe that God is the author of creation.
For those Christians who hold a <b>fundamentalist / creationist</b><b> view</b>,
there is a contrast with humanists in both the mechanics and the source of creation. </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>The human person</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>The human person is of paramount importance</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> <b> Humanists and Christians alike regard the human person as being
		      of supreme value.</b> The humanist concept of the human person is
		      essentially an optimistic one as it posits that <b>human beings
		      have thrived through their intelligent adaptation to the environment
	      and their problem solving capabilities</b>.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>People have social responsibilities</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Since both humanists and Christians acknowledge that
		    the human person is of extreme value, it follows that both <b>humanists
		    and Christians hold the belief that people have certain communal or social
	      responsibilities towards each other</b>. </p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Needs of the individual are paramount </p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> <b> </b>Following on from the humanist belief in the supreme
		    value of the human person, another notable characteristic of the humanist
		    understanding of the human person is the <b>utilitarian</b> belief
		    in the idea that the needs of the individual should not be compromised
		    other than for the greater good of society. This can be summed up with
		    the principle, that the <b>needs of the individual
are paramount</b>.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Source of this view</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Christians and humanists differ somewhat in their
		    view of the human person. For Christians, <b>human beings are made
		    in the likeness of God</b> and hence are sacred. This additional dimension
		    regarding the intrinsic sanctity of the human being is not present
		    in humanist beliefs. Thus, humanists believe that communal and <b>social
		    responsibilities are derived purely from human experience</b>, whereas
		    for Christians such<b> responsibilities are understood as being derived
	      from the revelation of God.</b></p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Social responsibility</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Belief that people have social responsibilities towards each other </p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Both Christians and humanists hold strong views on
		    social responsibility and community involvement. A fundamental tenet of
		    these worldviews is respect for all human beings, who are worthy of equal
		    consideration, freedom of belief and expression, and tolerance of other
		    beliefs and ways of life. This is because ultimately <b>both belief
		    systems aim to make the world a better place for all people to live in</b>,
		    and hence the improvement of the overall living of all people occupies
	      a central position in both Christian and humanist thinking.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Source of this view</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>There are two significant points of disparity between
		    the humanist and Christian view of social responsibility. The first
		    difference relates to the nature of the doctrines the respective worldviews
		    have regarding social responsibility. <b>Most Christian groups have
		    specific doctrines on social responsibility</b>, which are set out
		    in the Bible and in the teaching authorities of the tradition. <b>Humanist
		    doctrines</b>,
	      whilst they are similar, are <b>not as clearly defined</b>.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Life after physical death</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The second point of divergence lies in the implications
		    of the belief in the existence of a life after physical death. <b>Humanists</b>,
		    because they have no belief in an afterlife, <b>tend to place a greater
		    emphasis on the contributions made by people in this life</b>. <b>Some
		    Christian groups</b> however, because they believe in the notion of
		    life after death, have been <b>criticised for placing too much emphasis
		    on the concerns of the afterlife</b> and therefore neglecting the
	      needs of people in this life.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Material accumulation of goods</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Social responsibility is a wide encompassing concept
		    which involves addressing issues such as poverty, ecological concerns,
		    world peace, justice and economic inequality. One important area of social
		    action relates to the inequality in the distribution of material goods
		    and possessions. Both groups have strong views on this issue, as <b>both
		    groups regard the excessive accumulation of possessions or resources as
		    being harmful</b>,
		    particularly when there is an inequality in the distribution of these
		    goods.</p>
		  <p>That
		      is not to say however, that Christians and humanists reject the
		    notion of material accumulation. In fact, both groups believe that material
		    accumulation and possession is a natural part of life, it is only the <b>excessive accumulation
		      of such goods</b> that<b> needs to be addressed</b>. This
		      is particularly the case when the accumulation of wealth and possessions
		      takes place at the expense of others who are deprived of the basic
		      necessities of life. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Ecological sustainability</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Another area of concern for the Christian and humanist
		    community is ecological sustainability. There are <b>distinct similarities
		    in their practical approach towards ecological concerns</b> as both
		    regard the protection of the environment as critical. Hence, it is no surprise
		    to find that humanists and Christians are <b>both significant contributors
		    to ecological activism</b>. However, whilst there are distinct similarities
		    between the Christians and humanist worldviews in their practical attitudes
		    towards this issue there is a difference in the motivation behind their
	      involvement.</p>
		  <p> Christians are assiduous advocates for environmental protection because
		    they believe that the <b>earth is a product of God</b> and this <b>relationship
		    between the creator and creation needs to be sustained</b>. Christians
		    regard human beings as stewards of this earth and related to the rest of
		    creation in a profound way. Humanists on the other hand, are motivated
		    to protect the environment in the belief that <b>human beings are
		    dependant upon the environment for survival</b>, but do not hold the
		    same sense of relationship with a creator.</p>
		  <p> Both humanists and Christians have been criticised by some environmentalists
		    both for past actions and present attitudes to the environment. Once again
		    these criticisms highlight some similarities and differences. Humanists
		    have been criticised in the past for holding a Cartesian view of the world,
		    which encourages a human mastery over nature. Similarly Christian attitudes
		    based on the idea of Genesis creation account calling for the "subduing
		    the earth" can be seen in certain lights to encourage a kind of exploitation
		    of the environment.</p>
		  Other criticisms levelled at humanists focus on their emphasis on the
		  human being as a kind of "speciesist" excess which tends to place
		  other aspects of the environment at the service of humankind or which places
		  such an emphasis on human values that it subordinates other aspects of the
		  environment to the needs of human beings. In contrast, the Christian view
		  of creation and the relationship with creator and the rest of creation have
		  tended to enable it to avoid such criticism. </div>
