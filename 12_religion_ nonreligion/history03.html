		  <p>The <b>global Buddhist population is located predominantly in Asia</b>,

		<div class="footnote"><p> How Buddhism began and the history of its dispersion </p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Buddhism grew as an off-shoot of its mother religion Hinduism. Buddhism
		  was founded by Siddhartha Gautama in the Ganges Plain approximately
		    2500 years ago. Prior to the death of the Buddha in 483 BCE, Buddhism
		    was largely restricted to northern India, and to some villages of west
		    India. In the century that the Buddha died, <b>Buddhism spread into
		    Central Asia</b>.
		  The spread of Buddhism into central Asia was largely the result of
		    the influence of an Indian king by the name of <b>King Asoka</b> who
		    became the first Buddhist to send out missionaries to spread and
		    proclaim the works of Guatama. The work of these missionaries was largely
		    restricted to the Indian subcontinent.
		  </p>
		  <p> Asoka sent out emissaries to many nations outside India. For example, Asoka
  managed to convert the court of Ceylon, which is modern day Sri Lanka. Today
  Sri Lanka is ranked the sixth largest Buddhist country in the world. Asoka
  also spread the teachings of the Buddha as far as Burma ( Myanmar).</p>
<p> In the <b>first century CE, Buddhism had spread as far as China. </b> Buddhism
  was brought to China by missionaries and traders. But it was not till 300-500
  CE that Buddhism took hold in China with the introduction of <b>Mahayana
  Buddhism</b>. It should be noted that very early on in Buddhist history, <b>Buddhism
  split into two main strands: Mahayana Buddhism and Theravada Buddhism.</b> Following
  on from the popularity of Buddhism in China, Buddhism then continued to spread
  into <b>South East Asia</b><b>. Korea</b> became exposed
  to Buddhism in the <b>4th century</b>, as a result of close diplomatic
  ties with China.</p>
Within the next one hundred years, <b>Buddhism had travelled into Japan</b>.
Here the spread of Buddhism was initially met with resistance, though slowly
it infiltrated Japanese society. Buddhism reached <b>Tibet</b><b></b> in
the <b>8th century CE </b>and <b>Mongolia</b> became exposed
to Buddhism in <b>1500 CE.</b> </div>

		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b> Christianity, founded by Jesus of Nazareth, began
		    in what is known today as the Middle Eastern region. <b>During the

	      Christianity was entirely contained in this region.</p>
		  <p>Initially, the followers
		      of Jesus regarded themselves as belonging to a sect within Palestinian

		<div class="text">
		  <p> Within a decade of the death of Jesus, <b>Paul of Tarsus (Saint
		      Paul)</b>, who is often regarded as the second founder of Christianity,
		      began to <b>formalise the religion </b>and proclaim Christian
		      beliefs within its own system and structure. This enabled Christianity
		      to move outside the world of Palestinian Judaism and to be embraced
		      by <b>gentiles
		      of the Graeco-Roman world</b>. As a result of this, Christianity
		      as an underground movement, began to <b>grow in the Roman Empire</b>,

		  <p>It was not until the <b>fourth century CE</b>, however, under

		    first became an accepted religion. Within a century <b>Christianity
		    had become the state religion of the Roman Empire</b>. This enabled
		    it to <b>thrive</b> and

		  <p> Five centuries later, following the widespread practise of Christianity

		  <p> Origins of Judaism</p>

		<div class="text">
		  <p>It can be said that the history of Judaism has been marked by a series
		    of conquests and subsequent exiles. This history of subjugation and persecution
		    has a significant bearing upon the global distribution of Jews today. <b>Judaism
		    developed in the ancient land of Canaan</b>, which is known today,
		    as Israel. After centuries of exile, as a result of <b>persecution
		    and conquest by the Assyrians</b>,
then the <b>Babylonians</b> and finally by the <b>Romans</b>,
the <b>Jewish people came to be scattered across Europe and the Middle East</b>.
Over time, Jews came to be assembled around Poland, Russia, Romanian, and Germany.
The notion of the <b>Jewish Diaspora</b> began in the 6th century
BCE, and has been a continuing theme in Jewish history up to the present time.
It should be noted that Judaism, like the other major religious traditions is
diverse in the sense that there are various strands within that one religion.
Groups such as Orthodox, Conservative and Progressive provide an indication of
the diversity of expression within Judaism.</p>

		<div class="text">
		  <p> During the <b>twentieth century, many Jews migrated to the US, which
		      now hosts the largest population of Jews in the world</b>. During
		      World War II, the Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler sought to the
		      destroy the Jewish population of Europe The result of this attempted
		      genocide, known as the <b>holocaust</b>, resulted in the death
		      of approximately 6 million European Jews out of a population of approximately
	      8 or 9 million.</p>

		<div class="text">
		  <p>Following the holocaust, the abhorrence felt by the international community
		    at the clinical nature of Nazi genocide helped to fuel the <b>Zionist</b> dream
		    of establishing a Jewish homeland. In <b>1948</b> the United
		    Nations sponsored the reformation of the <b>Jewish state of Israel</b> in
		    the Palestinian territories.</p>
		  <p>The establishment of the state of <b>Israel</b> the
		      Jewish homeland has quickly led to it becoming one of the significant
		    Jewish populations in the world and is today <b>home to the second largest

		  <p>It is often <b>difficult to be sure of the exact number of Jews</b> living
in any given area as Jewish people are often sensitive about disclosing their
religious identity to public authorities for fear that they may be persecuted
either at the present time or some time in the future.</p>
