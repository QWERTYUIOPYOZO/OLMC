		<div class="footnote"><p>&nbsp;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Archaeological investigation provides clear evidence
		    to support the idea that prehistoric human communities displayed
		    signs of religious beliefs. An examination of archaeological evidence has
		    led numerous scholars to formulate theories as to how religion began in
		    prehistoric times. No one theory has gained universal acceptance though
		    there are several major theories, which have made significant contributions
		    to the study of the origins of religion. Several prominent figures in the
		    development of such theories are, Sir Edward Burnett Tylor, Friedrich Max
		    Muller and Wilhelm Schmidt.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>One of the earliest and most influential theories developed on this issue
		    of the <b>origins of religion</b> was formulated by nineteenth
		    century British anthropologist, Sir <b>Edward Burnett Tylor</b>.
		    In 1871, Tylor put forward the theory of <b>animism</b> in his
		    book, "Primitive
Culture". According to Tylor, prehistoric people believed that <b>all
natural objects</b>, including living creatures, <b>had a soul </b>or
spirit, which existed separately and independently of its physical being. It
was this force, prehistoric people believed, that controlled the activities of
the natural world.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>How prehistoric communities formulated the theory of animism</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Animism is the belief that <b>natural events</b> such as windstorms,
		    the transition from day to night, tornadoes, and volcanic eruptions <b>could
		    be attributed to the actions of the spirits</b>, also known as "animae".
		    Tylor argues that prehistoric communities firstly revered and then
		    later worshipped these spirits, because the natural phenomena which
		    these spirits produced were often so impressive and completely beyond normal
		    human capacities. Prehistoric people began to worship these spirits
		    as these natural phenomena affected their day-to-day life.</p>
		  <p>According to Tylor,
		    however, religion did not begin simply as a result of prehistoric
		    people observing the awe-inspiring might of the natural world. Tylor
		    also believed that on top of observing the power of the natural forces
		    an additional element was required - that
		    is awareness by prehistoric people of the existence of "animae" which
		    came about as a result of witnessing events such as death and dreams.
		    When primitive people dreamt about people or animals that had already
		    died they may have formed the idea that these dead people had spirits,
		    otherwise these dead people or animals would not have come to them in dreams.
		    This belief in the spirits of the departed led to an awareness of the presence
		    of spirits in all aspects of the natural world.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Polytheism is generally considered to have developed from animism </p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>From this worship of elements such as water, fire, rivers and mountains come
the beginnings of polytheistic religious practices. This belief that polytheistic
religions must have been derived from simpler forms of religious practice should
be seen against the background of influential theories around that time, developed
by thinkers such as Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer who both stressed the
idea that a complex society developed from a simple one. Thus evolution is characterised
by the transition from the basic to the sophisticated.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Implications of the belief in animism</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The belief that all living things have souls or spirits has a number
		  of implications. Firstly, <b>all facets of the natural world</b>,
		  from the inanimate elemental forces of nature to the animate flora
		  and fauna, <b>were
		  considered as being more or less of equal importance</b>. This is because
		  everything was perceived as being endowed with a spirit or soul. Therefore,
		  it was <b>important for human beings to treat animals with respect</b>.
		  Not only were human beings seen as being of equal importance to all
		  other soul carrying agents, they were seen as an integral part of this natural
		  world.
		  </p>
		  <p> This concept of the world and of the role in which human beings play, is
  diametrically opposed to the modern perception of the world which is characterised
  by a Cartesian belief in the superiority of human beings who are separate and
  independent from the natural world.</p>
<p> Secondly, prehistoric hunter-gatherer communities believed that the <b>spirit</b>,
  or supernatural being, that inhabits both animate and inanimate agents, <b>survives
  physical death</b>. Precisely what prehistoric people believed would happen
  to a soul or spirit after physical death is unclear. In some cultures it is
  believed that this soul moves unto a better world, a world of fertile vegetation,
  easy game, and abundant crops.</p>
Other cultures held the belief that these souls must transmigrate to a spirit
world or else risks becoming a wandering ghost. Alternatively, other prehistoric
communities believed that because the soul lives on even after the death of the
physical agent inhabited by the soul. The soul continues to play an active role
amongst the living. Thus, rituals are undertaken to appease these wandering spirits.
Such rituals are intended to ensure the abundance of food, provision of shelter
and overall wellbeing. They are also intended to help stave off the activities
of evil spirits. <b>Shamans</b><b>, </b>who are<b> priests
that possess great spiritual powers, </b>undertake these rituals in animistic
cultures<b>.</b>

		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Most scholars have rejected the theory of animism</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Although Tylor's theories are not universally accepted they were,
		    nevertheless, highly influential during his time and continue to influence
		    the work of modern scholars. The controversial nature of Tylor's
		    theories encouraged other historians and anthropologists to develop alternate
	      theories to account for the origins of religion. </p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Muller's alternative to the theory of animism</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>One such academic was nineteenth century German scholar, Friedrich Max
		    Muller, who is also famously known as the first historian of religion.
		    Muller agreed with Tylor insofar as accepting Tylor's idea that religion
		    began as spirit worship. However, Muller discounts Tylor's notion
		    that such spirits inhabited the natural world. Instead Muller has argued
		    for the view that these souls were anthropomorphic spirits in the sense
		    that these spirits were endowed with human emotions such as anger and hence
		    had good or bad tempers. It was these spirits, Muller argues, that became
	      to be revered as deities.</p>

		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Animism is still prevalent in some cultures today</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> While <b>animism is often associated with prehistoric or preliterate
		      communities</b> it is, however, still a <b>predominant feature
		      of some communities and cultures today</b>. For example, the traditional
		      religion and spirituality of Australian Aboriginal people has animistic
		      features as does the traditional religions of Melanesian, Polynesian
		      and Micronesian communities of the Oceanic region. There are also
		      features of animism found among African communities as well as the beliefs
	      of the Native American Indians.</p>

		<div class="content2"><h2>Polytheism</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> Polytheism</b><b> is the belief in and
		      worship of multiple gods or deities</b> . Polytheism is often contrasted
            with monotheism, which is the belief in and worship of one god, and
            one god only. <b>Polytheism is generally believed as having
            developed from animism</b>. Some theories suggest that, in turn,
            monotheism then developed from polytheism. However, there is considerable
          debate on such theories.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Theory of original monotheism</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b> Wilhelm Schmidt for example, presents a
		    very different view on this issue of the developmental stages of religion.
		    He argues that monotheism and the idea of the higher god was the first
		    form of religion, which over time was replaced by polytheism as primitive
		    societies grew more sophisticated. It was only later that monotheism was
		    revived. Schmidt's view is known
		  as the <b>"Ur-monotheism school",</b> or more commonly
		  as the theory of <b>"original monotheism"</b>.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Characteristics of polytheistic religious systems</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b>Typically, <b>polytheistic deities
		      are invested with their own stories, individual personalities, particular
		      skills and a position in the hierarchy of gods</b>. These characteristics
		      of polytheism can be held in stark contrast with the God of Judaism,
		      Christianity and Islam, where there are no stories of God's genealogy,
		      personal history, or of cosmogony and theogony. Similarly, where the
		      God of the Judaic-Christian tradition is depicted as an impersonal creator
		      god, the gods of polytheistic religious systems commonly have personalities,
		      disagreements with other gods, personal likes and dislikes which makes
		      them very similar to human beings.
		  </p>
		  <p> Because of these characteristics, it can be argued that the deities of polytheistic
  religious systems are more personal and accessible than the typically distant
  high god of monotheistic religious systems. Furthermore, unlike the omnipotent
  God of the Judaic-Christian tradition, polytheistic divinities are <b>rarely
  all powerful and all knowing</b>.</p>
<p> Polytheistic gods resemble human beings in the sense that these gods have
  limitations upon their powers, even though they often have special powers or
  skills and are <b>generally immortal</b>. For example, often these
  gods are depicted as having <b>jurisdictional skills and powers</b>,
  which range from controlling a particular family to the governance of fertility
  and childbearing. However, the existence of a supreme, all powerful, all knowing
  being is still possible within polytheistic belief systems.</p>
It follows therefore, that since there are a vast number of gods with individual
skills and levels of importance, <b>each god is allocated a specific position
in the pantheon</b>. The existence of multiple divinities necessitates a
highly stratified and structured divine world. This is another defining characteristic
of polytheistic belief systems, which makes it different from monotheism. 
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Polytheism existed in many ancient societies</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b><b>Many ancient religions were polytheistic</b> .
		    In fact, in the history of the major global or world religions, the polytheistic
		    religions generally appeared after animistic practices and before
		    the development of monotheism. For example, many pre-Christian societies
		    in Europe held polytheistic religious beliefs, as did many other
		    communities throughout the world. </p>
		  <p>However, whilst there is some tendency to associate the practise
		      of polytheism with the idea of ancient and primitive societies,
		    it should be noted that polytheistic religious practices are generally
		    only found in the more advanced societies of the historical period. That
		    is, a society which has a sophisticated form of agriculture, a stratified
              social system, and some form of political structure. Examples of
		      this trend can be readily seen at the time of the Graeco-Roman
		    empires. </p>

		<div class="footnote"><p>Distinction between "soft" and "hard" polytheism</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b> Typical examples of polytheistic religious
		    traditions include Hinduism and Buddhism. Followers of certain strands
		    of Hinduism and Buddhism, point out however that such a classification
		    is not strictly correct. The root of the issue lies in the confusion
	      between what is typically known as <b>"hard" polytheism</b> and <b>"soft" polytheism</b>.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Hard polytheism </p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b>            <b> Hard polytheists conceive
		      of their gods as being distinct and separate entities</b> . An example
		      of a hard polytheism is contained in Homer's Iliad and the Odyssey
		      which records the interaction between the pantheon of Greek gods, their
		      individual struggles, the internal bickering between gods, the alliances
		      and pacts made, and their intervention in the affairs of mortal beings.
            Other hard polytheistic pantheons include the <b>gods of the
            Norse tradition, the Aztec deities, the Egyptian gods, and the Sumerian
          deities.</b></p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">

		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b>            <b> </b> <b> Soft
		      polytheism</b> by contrast does not conceive of the gods as being
		      distinct and separate. Rather these pantheons of <b>gods are understood
		      as representing facets of a single god</b>. Some strands of Hinduism
		      can be considered as examples of soft polytheism. These particular
		      Hindus subscribe to a notion known as the Smartha philosophy, whereby
		      the various divinities worshipped are understood as different manifestations
	      of the one power known as <b>Brahman</b>.</p>

		<div class="content2"><h2>Monotheism</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b>            <b> </b> <b> </b> <b> Monotheism</b><b> is
		      the belief that there is only one god. </b> Typically, this god
		      is understood as an<b> all powerful, all knowing and ever present
		      being who created the world. </b>This eternal high god is usually
		      credited with giving the human world its <b>moral code</b>.
		      Thus, monotheism is expressed in the <b>religious systems of Judaism,
		      Christianity and Islam</b>. In evolutionary terms, monotheism is
		      usually understood as being a more developed form of religious
		      expression then polytheism. <b>Monotheism is often regarded as having
	      developed from polytheism</b>. However, this theory is often disputed.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Examples of monotheistic thought throughout history </p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b>            <b> </b> <b> </b> <b> </b> While
		    monotheism is usually associated with the religious systems of Christianity,
		    Judaism and Islam, it should be noted that monotheistic thought existed
		    prior to the existence of these three major monotheistic religions. Thinkers
		    in Greek antiquity such as Plato, Xenophanes and Aristotle often spoke
		    of a united, singular divine reality. But the precise nature of this unitary
	      reality was often a topic of contention.</p>
		  <p>Xenophanes spoke
		    of the "All-One",
		    Aristotle spoke of an eternal God and Plato stressed the idea that
		    God was all-good. But the idea of monotheism existed in ancient Egypt even
		    earlier than classical antiquity. In ancient Egypt, during the reign of
		    Amunhotep, Amun was installed as the one true god, and the only god that
		    was allowed to be worshipped. The presence of an exclusive worship of a
		    single deity can also be found in <b>Zoroastrianism</b> and in
		    some strands of Buddhism and Hinduism. </p>

		<div class="text">
		  <p>            <b> </b>            <b> </b> <b> </b> <b> </b>Whilst
		    monotheism affirms the belief in a universal, all encompassing god, there
are varying interpretations with regards to exactly what this means. <b>Deism</b> is
a form of monotheism that affirms the <b>belief in the oneness of god but
rejects the notion that god is an active agent in human history</b>. In
the sense that god is understood as not playing an active part in human history.
Deists also believe that since god does not intervene in human history, the revelation
of god through human history is not possible.</p>

		    a philosophy that provides another interpretation of monotheism.
		    It may be useful to understand pantheism, in terms of how it differs from
		    deism. Firstly, unlike deism, pantheism acknowledges the intervention of
		    god in human history. In fact, pantheism puts forward the notion that <b>every
		    part of creation is intrinsically a result of god's activities on
		    earth</b>. The implication of such a belief is that god is seen not
		    as separate and independent from nature but is seen as part of nature
		    and thus not able to be understood apart from nature.</p>
