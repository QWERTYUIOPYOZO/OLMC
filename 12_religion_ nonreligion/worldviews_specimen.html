	                                <p> Atheism is the disbelief in the existence
	                                  of transcendental beings. Therefore, atheists
	                                  believe that nothing exists outside of the
	                                  human. Since there is nothing outside of the
	                                  human, there is no ultimate purpose to human
	                                  life, and no life beyond physical death. Atheists
	                                  have come to this conclusion after examining
	                                  evidence which is supposed to point towards
	                                  the existence of a transcendental reality
	                                  . Atheists regard such evidence as inconclusive
	                                  and insufficient to prove what it is meant
	                                  to prove. According to atheists therefore,
	                                  the world did not come about as a result of
	                                  the actions of god or gods but through scientific
	                                  processes such as the Big Bang and evolution.
	                                  Agnosticism is the belief that at the current
	                                  time, evidence pointing towards the existence
	                                  of a divine reality is insufficient. But agnostics
	                                  have not closed the question of the existence
	                                  of god or gods altogether. Agnostics say that
	                                  they will believe in the notion of god or
	                                  gods, if at a future date, there is more sufficient
	                                  , conclusive empirical evidence to support
	                                  the existence of god or gods.</p>

	                                    to the search for personal fulfilment for

	                                <p> Non-religious humanism is a secular answer
	                                  to the search for personal fulfilment for
	                                  some individuals. Humanism is an active philosophy,
	                                  which includes atheists and addresses the
	                                  fundamental religious questions by stating
	                                  that this life and this world are all we have.
	                                  Since, there are no such things as god or
	                                  gods, we have control over our lives and our
	                                  destinies. Humanists aspire to help themselves,
	                                  and other people to live full, happy lives
	                                  because of their belief that this life is
	                                  the only life we have. Since humanists do
	                                  not believe in the existence of a transcendental
	                                  being or beings, humanists in their search
	                                  for personal fulfilment reject the notion
	                                  of life after physical life, and the idea
	                                  that the world was created by a divine being.
	                                  H umanists turn to human life and experience
	                                  to base our moral codes upon. From human experience
	                                  , humanists have concluded that human rationality,
	                                  compassion and intelligence make us capable
	                                  of improving not only our own lives but also
	                                  the lives of others. Therefore, humanism because
	                                  it believes in the supreme value of the human
	                                  being, gives meaning to the lives of some
	                                  individuals by emphasising this doctrine of
	                                  social and communal responsibility. Humanists
	                                  stress therefore, that h uman potential is
	                                  far greater then current achievement and hence
	                                  all humanists should aspire to reach this
	                                  potential.</p>

	                                <p>Rational and scientific humanism are two
	                                separate schools of humanism. Historically,
	                                rational humanism, which is also popularly
	                                known as secular humanism began during the Age
	                                of Enlightenment, a European intellectual movement
	                                of the 17th and 18th centuries. This spirit
	                                of rational progress influenced the development
	                                of rational humanism because one of its key
	                                tenets is the notion that human progress
	                                through rational thought can be used to improve
	                                the quality of life for all of humankind. Furthermore,
	                                the Enlightenment suffused rational humanism
	                                with the democratic belief in the equality
	                                of all people. Scientific humanism or modern
	                                humanism, as its latter name suggests, is a
	                                relatively modern 20th century approach to
	                                humanism. This school of humanism emphasises
	                                the importance of science and technology in
	                                helping human beings to better the state of
	                                the world for other human beings. Many scientific
	                                humanists are heavily involved in contemporary
	                                issues such as environmental degradation, world
	                                peace, poverty, economic inequalities and the
	                                threat of nuclear war.</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
