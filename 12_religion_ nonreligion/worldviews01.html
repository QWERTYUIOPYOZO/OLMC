		<h1>Content Description</h1>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p /></div>
		<div class="text">		
		<p> There are many reasons for the increasing secularism in society, which
		  have contributed to the human search for personal fulfilment through non-religious
		  practices such as <b>agnosticism</b>, <b>atheism</b>,
		  and <b>humanism</b>. These reasons range from what some people
		  regard as the decline in the relevancy of traditional religion to day-to-day
		  life to the dissatisfaction experienced by other members in society regarding
	    mainstream religious institutions.</p>
		
		<p>However, the increasing secularism in a society does not mean that human
		beings are no longer searching for answers to the fundamental questions, which
		characterise human existence such as the questions of human origin, purpose
		and destiny. In fact, significant numbers are finding answers to these age-old
		questions through non religious practices such as atheism, agnosticism and
		humanism.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Atheism</h2>
        <div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> <b> Atheism is the doctrine, which posits the notion that no god
		      or divine being exists, and hence nothing divine exists outside
		      of humanity</b>.
		      Thus, the universe, the <b>earth </b>and its life <b>evolved
		      by a natural scientific process</b> without intervention by a supernatural
		      entity. Furthermore, atheists believe that since there is no god
		      or ultimate reality, <b>humanity has no ultimate goal </b>and
		      no further aspirations or imperatives because without the existence of
	      a god, there is no after life or next life.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		 <div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Failure of evidence to prove the existence of a transcendental reality</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> <b> </b> Atheists hold on to the principle that the belief
		    in a divine being is a fallacy. They believe the evidence that supposedly
		    points towards the existence of deities, fails to prove what it sets
		    out to show. It should be noted that atheism by itself is not a freestanding
		    belief system or religion. Rather atheism is a reactive philosophy
	      that denies the existence of God or gods.</p>
		</div>
		</div>  
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Historical development of atheism</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Modern atheism is largely the product of the seventeenth century European
		  Enlightenment movement. The <b>Age of Enlightenment</b> was an
		  intellectual movement that advocated the use of reason over religion
		  because the latter was associated with irrationality and primitive
		  superstitions. This era of empirical progress led to significant advances
		  in scientific knowledge which, at the time, was viewed by many as being incompatible
		  with backward looking, traditional religion.
		  </p>
		  <p> This spirit of radical progress was carried on to the Victorian age with
  thinkers such as Charles Darwin who, in the second half of the nineteenth century,
  proposed his groundbreaking theory of evolution, the validity of which, was
  seen as being incompatible with Biblical truths.</p>
The increasing tension between secularism and religion had broad social implications.
For example, this debate reverberated into eighteenth scholarship surrounding
issues such as the authenticity of the Biblical texts. During this time, archaeological
excavations and textual analysis of the Bible were undertaken to determine whether
the Bible was a valid and accurate historical record. </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Agnosticism</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p><b>Agnosticism is the belief that the evidence which is supposed
		      to prove the existence of God is insufficient at the present time.</b> Agnostics
		    do not believe there is sufficient evidence to warrant the belief
		      in the existence of a divine being. However, <b>such matters could
		      conceivably change in the future because if at a later date there
		      is sufficient evidence to prove the existence of God then their views
		      will change</b>.</p>
		  <p>The
		    term agnosticism was coined by nineteenth century scientist Thomas
		    Huxley who put together "a", which means not, with the word "gnosis" which
  is the Greek word for knowledge. This negative prefix to the word for knowledge
  underlined the assertion that there is not sufficient knowledge to require
		    a belief in the existence of a divine being. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Difference between atheists and agnostics</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Agnostics differ from atheists in the sense that they believe that the
		    existence of god is still a possibility though at the current time evidence
		    for the existence of god or gods is not conclusive. Atheists on the other
	      hand, regard the issue as being closed. </p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Humanism</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Humanism is a philosophy, which is based on the <b>belief that since
		      there is no evidence which points to the existence of a supernatural
	      being, then this life and this world are that matters</b>.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Key beliefs</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Therefore, in the light of this, <b>human beings should try to live
		  full, happy lives and make it easier for others to do the same</b>.
		  At the heart of humanism is the belief that human beings can and do
		  have <b>control
		  over their own destinies</b>, since supernatural intervention has been
		  proven to be impossible. Thus, it can be said that humanism is a philosophy
		  founded on the belief that <b>human</b> endeavour, <b>experience</b>,
		  intelligence and compassion, are the <b>foundations for all moral values</b>.
		  </p>
		  <p> Humanism holds onto the belief in the <b>intrinsic goodness of humanity</b>,
  but recognises that <b>human potential is far greater than current achievement</b>.
  Humanists retain faith in human compassion and the intelligence of human beings
  to solve problems and make this world a better place for all to live.</p>
Humanists also believe that human beings have been successful in evolutionary
terms due to an ability to manipulate and <b>adapt to the natural world
by working in a cooperative manner with other human beings</b>. Humanism
is a living philosophy that includes in its membership atheists but not agnostics.
This is because humanism essentially adopts a scientific view of life which argues
the view that evidence shows that this life, and this world are all we have.
Therefore, humanists reject evidence which points towards the existence of a
divine being.</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Christian humanism</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>In addition to rational and scientific humanism, which are essentially secular
worldviews, there is also Christian humanism. Christian humanism is a worldview
characterised by a belief in God tempered by a scientific rejection of some of
the key doctrines of Christianity, such as the immaculate conception and virgin
birth, whilst affirming the fundamental importance of the human being and his
or her achievements.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Historical development of humanism</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The origins of humanism are usually attributed to a period in history
		    known as the <b>Renaissance </b>which was a cultural movement
		    beginning in fourteenth century Europe. During this period of intellectual
		    discovery the writings of philosophers from classical antiquity were rediscovered
	      and applied to contemporary art and science.</p>
		  <p> As part of this rebirth of classical knowledge and revitalisation of
		    the European culture was a movement away from God and a re-emphasis on
		    the achievements and abilities of humankind. That is not to say that people
		    living during the Renaissance did not believe in the existence of God but
		    rather that they began to perceive God as being more of an impersonal force
		    which controlled the universe which allowed God's laws to be understood
		    through a detached scientific frame of mind.</p>
		  <p> This shift in focus from the medieval understanding of God, led people
		    to re-emphasise the capacity and intelligence of human beings to understand
		    the world around them, and to control their destiny.</p>
		  This climate of scientific, religious, literary and artistic upheaval
		  gave way to an eighteenth century period, known as the age of Enlightenment.
		  During this Age of Enlightenment rational humanism, which is also commonly
		  known as secular humanism, began as a school of formalist humanism. </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Rational Humanism</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition and origins of rational humanism</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The period of the Enlightenment fostered the spirit of <b>rational
		      humanism</b>,
which proclaimed the belief that <b>human progress through rational thought
could be utilised to better the quality of life for all of humankind</b>.
Furthermore the age of Enlightenment encouraged the idea of <b>modern democracy</b> and
egalitarianism, which became a fundamental precept of rational humanism. Thus,
rational humanism is a philosophy, which supports the use of reason, compassion,
equality, morality and ethics to build a better world for human kind.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2"><h2>Scientific Humanism</h2>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Definition and origins of scientific humanism </p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Sir Julian Huxley, the first Director-General of the United Nations' Educational,
		  Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), founded <b>scientific
		  humanism</b>, also known as modern humanism. Scientific humanism, as
		  its name suggests places a significant <b>emphasis upon science and
		  technology </b>to address the big problems of poverty, environmental
		  degradation, social inequalities and other global issues faced by contemporary
		  societies.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Scientific humanism is concerned with world peace and equality </p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Scientific humanism <b>strives to achieve equality and peace on a
		      global scale</b>. The term scientific humanism should be used with
		      caution however, because some scientific humanists feel that this term
		      does not encapsulate their beliefs, as many appeal to emotion and morality
		      in addition to reason in order to justify a moral belief.</p>
