		                            <p>There are numerous reasons as to why new
		                            expressions of religion are becoming increasingly
		                            popular. The most significant reason for
		                            the growth in new age religions is that they can
		                            provide personal fulfilment, in ways which traditional
		                            religious practices cannot. This search for personal
		                            fulfilment needs to be seen in conjunction with
		                            the belief held by many that guidance given by
		                            traditional religious groups is meaningless and
		                            irrelevant. This dissatisfaction of traditional
		                            religious institutions is a result of various factors.
		                            One prominent factor is the abuse scandals which
		                            have been brought to light by the media, which
		                            has the affect of diminishing the authority of
		                            Church leaders. Another reason for the growth of
		                            new age religions is that given this increasing
		                            secularity of society where traditional religious
		                            ethical guidance is increasingly seen as meaningless,
		                            it is almost inevitable that people will turn to
		                            new age religions, to provide an ethical code or
		                            a mechanism to determine ethical guidelines. Another
		                            aspect of modern society which has contributed
		                            to the growth of new age religions is the modern
		                            cult of individualism. In a society which
		                            emphasises individualism over communalism, some
		                            people may be left feeling isolated and alienated.
		                            As a result some people may turn to new age religions
		                            to fill this void, as new age religions can provide
        a sense of community and belonging.</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
