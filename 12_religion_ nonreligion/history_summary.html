	        <h3> Students learn to:</h3>
	        <p class="section_statement">Identify the following expressions of the religious
                  dimension in human history:</p>
            <ul class="section_statement">
             <li>Animism</li>
             <li>Polytheism</li>
             <li>Monotheism</li>
        </ul>
	        <h3> Animism</h3>
	        <ul class="summary_points">
              <li> Animism, in its simplest form is the idea that all living
                things have a soul </li>
              <li> Animism is the term coined by Edward Tylor as a proposed theory
                of the origins of religion </li>
              <li> Animism is the belief that all natural objects are endowed
                with a spirit or soul, known as "animae" </li>
              <li> This soul is understood to exist independently of the natural
                object it inhabits </li>
              <li> These spirits were believed to govern the day-to-day activities
                of the natural world </li>
              <li> Since all natural objects had souls, every part of creation
                had to treat every other part of creation with respect </li>
              <li> In some animistic societies, it is believed that the soul
                can survive physical death </li>
              <li> After physical death, some communities believed that the soul
                bec ame a wandering ghost that actively intervenes in the day-to-day
                lives of people who are still alive </li>
              <li> Other communities believed that the soul move d onto a more
                fertile world, where vegetation and game were plentiful </li>
              <li> Animistic cultures had priests, known as shamans who performed
                rituals to appease these wandering souls </li>
              <li> Animism is still a key feature of some communities today </li>
              <li> For example, animistic thought still features in the Australian
                Aboriginal, the Melanesian, Polynesian, the Micronesian and the
                Native American Indian cultures of today </li>
              <li> Tylor's theory, though it was influential during the
                nineteenth century, has been largely rejected by scholars today </li>
        </ul>
	        <h3> Polytheism</h3>
	        <ul class="summary_points">
              <li> Polytheism is the belief in and worship of multiple gods or
                deities </li>
              <li> Examples of polytheistic religious practice can be found in
                the Graeco-Roman cultures, as well as in the Hindu, Norse, Aztec,
                Egyptian and Sumerian traditions </li>
              <li> Though this theory has been disputed, it is generally believed,
                that polytheism developed from animism </li>
              <li> One typical characteristic of polytheis tic religious systems
                is that its deities resemble human beings in the sense that they
                have their own personalities, hold grudges against other gods,
                and have a personal history </li>
              <li> Another common feature of polytheis tic religious systems
                is that polytheistic divinities are rarely omniscient, omnipotent
                and omnipresent </li>
              <li> Polytheistic deities are usually assigned jurisdictional powers,
                which are directly linked with their particular skill or talent </li>
              <li> Gods of the polytheistic religious system are generally immortal,
                and hence are often referred to as the " I mmortals" </li>
              <li> Polytheistic religious systems are usually highly stratified,
                which each god being given their own position within this hierarchy </li>
              <li> Most ancient religions were polytheistic, and even today some
                tribal cultures and religions have remained polytheistic </li>
              <li> Hard polytheists conceive of their gods as being distinct
                and separate entities </li>
              <li> Soft polytheism is the belief that all the different gods
                embody a particular facet of a unitary, singular god or reality</li>
        </ul>
	        <h3> Monotheism</h3>
	        <ul class="summary_points">
              <li> Monotheism is the belief that there is only one god </li>
              <li> The term monotheism is best used to describe the religious
                system adopted by the three major monotheistic traditions, Christianity,
                Islam and Judaism </li>
              <li> Traces of monotheistic thought can also be found in the works
                of Greek antiquity, in cultures such as ancient Egypt and in
                traditions such as Zoroastrianism </li>
              <li> It is generally believed that monotheism developed from polytheism,
                though this theory has been disputed </li>
              <li> The god of monotheistic religious systems is usually depicted
                as an omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent being </li>
              <li> Generally, this divine being is credited with the creation
                of the universe, and is responsible for giving humankind its
                moral code </li>
              <li> Deism and pantheism are two varying forms of monotheism </li>
              <li> Deism affirms the notion that there is only one god , but
                rejects the idea that god actively intervenes in human history </li>
              <li> Pantheism equates god with the universe </li>
              <li>Therefore, pantheists
                believe that every part of creation is intrinsically a result
              of god's activities on earth</li>
        </ul>

	        <p class="section_statement">The significance of the religious
                  dimension in human history</p>
	        <h3> Students learn to:</h3>
	        <p class="section_statement">Evaluate the place of the religious dimension in human
                  history to provide:</p>
            <ul class="section_statement"> 
              <li>Meaning and purpose for the individual</li>
              <li>Social cohesion</li>
              <li>Social transformation</li>
            </ul>
	        <h3> Meaning and purpose for the individual</h3>
	        <ul class="summary_points">
              <li> Human experience is characterised by a search for answers
                to the big questions of life, which are known as the key religious
                questions </li>
              <li> The most significant of these questions relate to the origin
                (where did we come from?), purpose (why are we here?) and destiny
                (what happens to us when we die?) of humankind </li>
              <li> The answers provided through religion understanding give meaning
                and coherence to life </li>
              <li> One significant role of religion is to provide life with meaning,
                and hence a sense of overall consistency and direction in a world
                that is constantly changing </li>
              <li> During times of crises for example , religion is particularly
                uplifting because it provides life with a sense of purpose ,
                and a framework upon which to understand life </li>
              <li> The ritualistic dimension of religion provides individuals
                with one of the most basic needs of humankind, a sense of belonging
                within a community </li>
              <li> Religion can also serve to reinforce the cultural identity
                of a group, which is particularly important when the group consists
                of small ethnic minorities or people who have been socially marginalised
                by mainstream society </li>
        </ul>
	        <h3> Social cohesion</h3>
	        <ul class="summary_points">
              <li> Religion has an important role in affirming traditional beliefs
                and practices </li>
              <li> Religion provides communities with a sense of continuity as
                it serves to link the rapidly changing, complex modern society
                with a more traditional and stable past </li>
              <li> The downside of religion as a force of social cohesion is
                that religion can also used to reinforce and legitimise values
                and institutions, which may be unjust eg. Slavery</li>
        </ul>
	        <h3> Social transformation</h3>
	        <ul class="summary_points">
              <li> Paradoxically, whilst religion is a force of social cohesion
                it can also serve as a force of social transformation </li>
              <li> Religion can be used as a tool for criticising the structures,
                customs and beliefs of its own societies </li>
              <li> The importance of working towards a just and peaceful society
                is integral to the message of all major religious traditions </li>
              <li> Historically, religious groups have played a significant role
                in advocating and campaigning for social justice and equality              </li>
              <li>Today religious groups can be seen at the forefront of campaigns,
	          which seek to address issues such as poverty, environmental degradation,
          global conflict, economic inequality, indigenous rights and unemployment</li>

	        <h3> Buddhism</h3>
	        <ul class="summary_points">
              <li> Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama in approximately
                500 BCE </li>
              <li> Buddhism began as an offshoot of its mother religion, Hinduism </li>
              <li> Buddhism began in the Ganges Plain </li>
              <li> King Asoka sent out missionaries to spread the word of the
                Buddha in the 5 th century BCE which resulted in the spread of
                Buddhism to Central Asia, Burma and Sri Lanka </li>
              <li> From the 3 rd to the 5 th century CE Mahayana Buddhism became
                firmly rooted in China </li>
              <li> In the 4 th century CE Mahayana Buddhism spread to Korea </li>
              <li> In the 5 th century CE Mahayana Buddhism spread to Japan </li>

                Mongolia, Tibet, Vietnam and in some parts of India and Russia </li>
              <li> Today Theravada Buddhism is mainly located in Burma, Cambodia,
                Laos, Sri Lanka and Thailand </li>
              <li> Buddhism is steadily growing from a small base in Western
                countries </li>
              <li> The 10 largest national populations of Buddhism are: (in descending
                order) China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Cambodia,
                India, South Korea and Taiwan</li>
        </ul>
	        <h3> Christianity</h3>
	        <ul class="summary_points">
              <li> During the life of Jesus of Nazareth, (founder of Christianity)
                and in the immediate aftermath of his death the Jesus movement
                was largely restricted to the Roman province of Palestine and
                to the immediate surrounding areas </li>
              <li> Paul of Tarsus ( Saint Paul), who is typically regarded as
                the second founder of Christianity, assisted Christianity to
                move out of its Judaic-Palestinian confines by formalising the
                religion, and providing Christianity with an infrastructure </li>
              <li> Christianity grew as an underground movement that faced intermittent
                persecution in the Roman Empire up to the 4 th century CE </li>
              <li> Under the patronage of Emperor Constantine, Christianity became
                a state religion in the 4 th century </li>
              <li> As a result of this, Christianity began to thrive and grow
                rapidly in the Roman Empire </li>
              <li> The Great Schism of 1054 formalised a division between Western
                Christianity and Eastern Orthodoxy </li>
              <li> Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe during
                the Middle Ages as a result of missionaries who were sent out
                to convert local European tribes who were seen as barbaric </li>
              <li> The Reformation of the 16 th century, split Western Christianity
                into the Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches </li>
              <li> The age of European colonisation from the 15 th century onwards
                saw the spread of Christianity to Asia, Africa and North America </li>
              <li> Christianity is the largest religion in the world today </li>
              <li> The 10 largest national populations of Christianity are: (in
                descending order) USA, Brazil, Mexico, Philippines, China, Russia,
                India, Nigeria, Germany and Zaire/Congo </li>
              <li> There is a clear trend in the recent development of Christianity
                which points to its steady decline in the Western world and its
                rapid growth in Asia, Africa and Latin America </li>
        </ul>
	        <h3> Hinduism</h3>
	        <ul class="summary_points">
              <li> Hinduism began in the Punjab region 4000 years ago </li>
              <li> The vast majority of the Hindu's in the world are found
                in India and surrounding areas </li>
              <li> The 10 largest national populations of Hinduism are: (in descending
                order) India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan,
                Malaysia, USA, South Africa and Burma (Myanmar) </li>
              <li> Hinduism is largely restricted to the Indian sub-continent </li>
              <li> Hindus are generally located in the Indian subcontinent because
                Hinduism is largely dependant upon the Indian cultural environment
                for its existence </li>
              <li> Another reason as to why Hinduism is largely restricted to
                the Indian subcontinent is that Hinduism lacks the doctrine of
                self propagation, unlike the other major religious traditions </li>
              <li> Furthermore, the diverse nature of Hinduism works against
                the possibility of its spreading easily with a single recognisable
                doctrine </li>
        </ul>
	        <h3> Islam</h3>
	        <ul class="summary_points">
              <li> Islam was founded by the Prophet Muhammad in 622 CE in Madinah </li>

                to Palestine, Syria, Persia, Damascus, Persia, Jerusalem, Caesarea,
                Egypt, North Africa, and Spain which it dominated until the Middle
                Ages </li>
              <li> The Crusades which occurred between the 11 th and 13 th centuries
                facilitated the spread of Islam into Europe </li>
              <li> By the 10 th century CE, Islam had moved into Western Africa,
                China and India </li>
              <li> By the 14 th century CE, Islam was firmly cemented in Indonesia
                and Malaysia </li>
              <li> During the 19 th century, as a result of the efforts of missionaries,
                more people were converted to Islam on the African continent </li>
              <li> Many Muslims were resettled to Western countries such as the
                US and the UK in the post World War II period </li>
              <li> Islam is the fastest growing religion of the five major world
                religions today </li>

              <li> Islam is remaining strong in its traditional areas such as
                Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and is also growing steadily
                in Western countries </li>
              <li> The 10 largest national populations of Muslims are: Pakistan,
                India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Turkey, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria

	        <ul class="summary_points">
              <li> Jewish history is marked by a series of persecutions and exiles </li>
              <li> From the time it began to the Middle Ages, as a result of
                centuries of persecution the Jewish people came to be scattered
                across Europe and the Middle East </li>
              <li> Many Jews migrated to the US in the 20 th century </li>
