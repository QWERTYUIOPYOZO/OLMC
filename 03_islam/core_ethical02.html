									<h2>The process of Islamic jurisprudence</h2>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Jurisprudence</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The most important and <strong>fundamental point of reference</strong> for Islamic jurisprudence is the <strong>Qur'an</strong>. It provides the teachings that are to be followed by all Muslims and is regarded as <strong>normative</strong> for all aspects of Islam.
								<p>While the Qur'an is very clear and direct for the most part, it is also concise and quite brief. The statements in the Qur'an, while usually very clear in principle are also usually not sufficiently detailed to allow for direct application to some situations.
								<p>Where the Qur'an is not sufficiently clear or detailed on a particular issue, Muslims look to <strong>other sources</strong> to provide guidance for appropriate ethical actions. The overall process of discerning the appropriateness of actions in particular situations is known as <strong>jurisprudence</strong>.
								</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Qur'an</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The first step in the process of discernment will always be the <strong>Qur'an</strong>. Likewise the Qur'an is also the authority that places<strong> limits on the</strong> <strong>decisions of other authorities</strong> in Islam. Therefore it is not possible for a judgment to be accepted if it clearly contravenes an aspect of the Qur'an.</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Hadith and Sunna</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Beyond the Qur'an the next authorities to be consulted would be the collections of the <strong>traditions of the Prophet Muhammad</strong> known as the <strong>Hadith and the Sunna</strong>. These traditions convey the words and actions of Muhammad. Muslims consider these traditions to be particularly valuable where the Qur'an is not explicit or detailed in a given area.</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Hadith qudsi</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The most influential of these traditions are known as the <strong>sacred hadiths or hadith qudsi</strong>. These traditions are regarded as part of the revelation of Allah, however, unlike the Qur'an they are communicated in the <strong>words of the Prophet</strong> rather than the exact words of Allah.</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Fiqh</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The process of Islamic jurisprudence is known as fiqh which means <strong>knowledge or understanding</strong>. It refers to the process of studying shari'ah in a scholarly way, relating the legal practice to the revelation of the Qur'an and the traditions of the Prophet. 
							<p>The historical aspect of <strong>fiqh</strong> includes the <strong>systematic analysis of the Qur'an and Hadith</strong> in conjunction with the process of applying or working out principles through the use of analogy. This process is known as <strong>qiyas</strong>. This is a frequently used to determine appropriate responses to the complexities of modern issues where the Qur'an and the traditions are not sufficiently clear or detailed.
							</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Qiyas</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
There are <strong>two sorts of qiyas</strong> to consider. The first is essentially the exercise of a personal judgment on an issue. This is known as<strong> ijtihad</strong>. While ijtihad is permitted there is a clear risk of an individual's judgment being clouded by their own perspective and often by their own involvement in the matter.
</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Ijma</div>                                     
								<div class="text">A more reliable form of qiyas is that which draws on the decisions of renowned scholars from history. These <strong>scholarly judgments are known as ijma</strong>. They reflect a consensus of understanding by authorities in Islamic law. Such judgments have considerably more authority than individual judgments, however, they are <strong>not all binding</strong>.
								<p>The only instances of ijma which are considered universally binding are those where the decision reflects a <strong>consensus of the companions of the Prophet</strong>. Such judgments are regarded as being reliable and authentic given their proximity to the life and teaching of the Prophet himself.
								</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Consensus among authorities</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Sunni Muslims place particular value on the <strong>consensus of the scholars</strong> who are regarded as having sufficient expertise to exercise legitimate ijtihad. Such ijma reflected in this consensus is assumed to be <strong>divinely inspired and therefore binding</strong>.</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Mujtahids and Ayatollahs</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In the <strong>Shi'ia communities</strong> there is a particular weight given to the judgments of certain recognised authorities known either as <strong>mujtahids or ayatollahs</strong>. These act in the roles of <strong>leading Imams</strong> in the Shi'ia communities and are believed to be able to exercise ijtihad wisely and with authority. Therefore among the Shi'ia communities, the judgments of such authorities carry binding force.</div> 
							  </div><div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Madhhabs</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The historical aspects of Islamic jurisprudence have been most pronounced in the development of scholarship with the specific purpose of developing detailed <strong>formulations of Islamic law</strong>. These schools were known as <strong>madhhabs</strong>. There were<strong> five main schools </strong>which have had enduring influence. Each was named after the leading scholars; Jafar al-Sadiq, Malik, Abu Hanifa, Shafi'i and Ahmad ibn Hanbal.
								<p>Most Muslim communities today would follow one or other of these schools. Among followers of these schools there are moderate or modernist thinkers who believe that there is always need for reinterpretation of judgment in the light of new circumstances. In contrast some more fundamentalist thinkers believe that all the necessary judgments have been provided and it is now a matter of applying them faithfully.
