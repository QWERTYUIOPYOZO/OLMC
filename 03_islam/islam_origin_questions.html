									<h1>Specimen Questions </h1>
									<p><strong>Assess the importance of the Prophet Muhammad as a model for life in Islam.</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Analyse the relationship between the period of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs and the existence of major groupings within Islam today.</strong></p>
										  <h2>Sample Responses</h2>
											<p><strong>Assess the importance of the Prophet Muhammad as a model for life in Islam.</strong></p>
											<p>The Prophet Muhammad is regarded as the last of the Prophets of Allah, he is also regarded as the greatest of the Prophets. First and foremost the Prophet plays the role of bearing witness to the greatness of Allah. The fact that Muslims also look to the example of Muhammad as a guide or model in life is of secondary importance. It is, however, a significant element of life for Muslims.
											<p>The traditions of the Prophet Muhammad are found in the collections known as the Hadith and the Sunna. These record the teachings and the actions of Muhammad and they are widely used in Muslim communities. However, notwithstanding their popularity, the remain subordinate to the Qur'an as texts in Islam.
											<p>The issue of the importance of the Prophet's life as a model for Muslims can best be assessed by considering the example he set for Muslim life, his faith, his courage and his leadership qualities. All of these things are to be viewed from the perspective of one living in submission to Allah rather than as the achievements of Muhammad himself. Muslims believe that all Muhammad's achievements are a reflection of the love and power of Allah, not of Muhammad's own capabilities.
											<p>The word "Islam" means surrender and its meaning reflects the disposition sought after by all devout Muslims, namely surrender to the will of Allah. The Prophet Muhammad is regarded as the sublime example of surrender to the will of Allah and accordingly is seen by Muslims as a model for life. In this sense his life can be seen as a model for Islam. Not through his achievements but through his submission to the will of Allah.
											<p>In acclaiming the perfect submission of Muhammad to the will of Allah it is important not to attribute things to the Prophet which portray him as other than human. There is no sense in Islam that Muhammad is other than a human being. Despite various legends and extraordinary events that surrounded his life, he was, nonetheless, human. Great care is taken in Islam to ensure that respect for the Prophet Muhammad does not become a form of worship. Worship is for Allah only. This caution is expressed in the Qur'an "Muhammad is but a messenger; there have been many prophets before him, and they all died. (surah 3:144).
											<p>Muhammad is regarded as an important example or model fro Muslims, however, he is not the only such model. The idea of Muhammad as the final messenger reflects the understanding in Islam that the he stands in the long tradition of the prophets proclaiming the one true God. Most esteemed among these messengers are Ibrahim, Musa and Isa. All these great Prophets of Allah are worthy of respect and Muslims can learn from their example, just as they do with the life of the Prophet Muhammad. Muslims believe that with the Prophet Muhammad, the process of revelation has culminated and accordingly he is to be regarded as the last of the prophets or the final messenger of Allah.
											<p>There are a number of aspects of Muhammad's life which give witness to his total submission to the will of Allah and therefore provide important guides for Muslims to follow. The traditions of the actions of Muhammad are recorded in the Sunna while the traditions of Muhammad's teachings are recorded in the Hadith. Both these sources are helpful for Muslims in appreciating the significance of the Prophet's life and actions.
											<p>In Muhammad's early life there is evidence that he was a wise and capable leader. He quickly earned the trust and respect of his uncle Abu Talib and soon after of the widow Khadija. Both found him to be trustworthy, reliable and capable in business affairs. It is noted, however, that although these capabilities were shown before the night of power it was still in the context of Muhammad being a man of prayer and constant spiritual searching and thus experiencing the guidance and blessing of Allah even before the revelation came.
											<p>Even before receiving the revelation from the angel Jibril, Muhammad was living a life characterised by prayer and spiritual searching. He regularly took himself away for long periods of solitude and reflection.
											<p>Upon receiving the revelation from Jibril, Muhammad displayed a number of characteristics which are important for Muslims to develop. Firstly he showed faith and was prepared to place his trust in the word of Allah despite not knowing where it would lead. Secondly, he showed patience in waiting for the time to begin preaching. Although he experienced normal anxiety and uncertainty at this time he nevertheless surrendered his will to Allah and waited. It is in this willingness to submit fully to the will of Allah that Muhammad provides the greatest example for Muslims to follow.
											<p>Finally when he was given the command to preach the message he did so tirelessly and fearlessly. Muhammad encountered great opposition among the people of Makkah. He was ridiculed and persecuted for his words. The requirements of the message created great hostility towards him, particularly from those in Makkah who made their wealth from the exploitation of the worship of idols and the cult of the Ka'bah. Muhammad's willingness to remain faithful to the will of Allah during the most difficult of times is a further indication of his value as a model for Islamic life.
											<p>As a leader in Madinah, the Prophet Muhammad showed himself to be prudent and just. His rule was highlighted by practical wisdom such as the importance of forgiveness and overcoming anger. It also included elements of integrity and fair dealing such as the prompt payment of wages and avoidance of corruption. Further elements included codes for sexual morality as well as a reformist social agenda which addressed issues such as infanticide, respect for women and the abuse of slaves.
											<p>Finally, the community under Muhammad's leadership had a clear responsibility to care for its most vulnerable members. The Prophet Muhammad ensured that the community followed practices where the poor were supported by the offerings of all Muslims and not left destitute as would have been the case in most communities of the time.
											<p>The community at Madinah under Muhammad's leadership can also be seen as providing an example for Muslims to follow. Muhammad, through applying the word of Allah to the situation of the community was able to transform the community into an example of moral living according to the Qur'an. That is not to suggest that all within Madinah was without fault. Rather it is an indication that through applying the teachings of the Qur'an Muhammad was able to establish a framework for a true Muslim community.
											<p>It can be seen, therefore, that the Prophet Muhammad does provide an excellent model for Muslims to follow. This is evident through his faith, his courage and his qualities as a leader. However, in and through all Muhammad's achievements the most significant aspect of his example comes through his submission to the will of Allah. In this aspect first and foremost, Muslims can certainly follow the example of Muhammad. In all other things his example is also regarded as worthwhile. However, it is ultimately in the way that it reflects the basic principle of submission to Allah that Muhammad's life provides a model for Muslims.</p>
