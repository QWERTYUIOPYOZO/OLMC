									<h1>Content Description</h1>
						<h2>The Qur'an</h2>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Qur'an fundamental text for Islam</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								The <b>Qur'an</b> is the <b>fundamental text for all Muslims</b>. It is believed to contain the <b>revelation of Allah, complete and unaltered</b> as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad beginning with the first revelation on the night of power and continuing over hundreds of occasions during the remainder of his life.
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">114 surahs</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The Qur'an is <b>organised into 114 surahs</b> or chapters. The order of 
								the Qur'an today is not the same order in which the revelations were received. The <b>order 
								is according to an instruction</b> given to the Prophet Muhammad later in his life. 
								Each surah has a name which is linked to a feature or a word contained in it. It is not 
								always immediately clear why the name was given to some particular surahs. </p>
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Qur'an memorised</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Muhammad was not a literate person and accordingly he had to commit the 
								Qur'an to memory rather than have it written down. Muslims believe that to hear the Qur'an 
								read aloud is a blessing and so are encouraged to read it aloud.</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Hafiz</div>                                     
								<div class="text">During the life of the Prophet Muhammad, many of his companions <b>committed the entire Qur'an to memory</b>. A person who knows the entire Qur'an off by heart is known as a <b>hafiz</b>. Such a person is greatly honoured in the Muslim community.

								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Written version of Qur'an</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								It was the death of as many as seventy such <b>huffaz</b> in a battle after the death of 
								Muhammad that prompted the first of the four rightly guided caliphs, <b>Abu Bakr</b> to 
								begin the process of having a written version of the Qur'an developed. He commissioned 
								<b>Zaid ibn Thabit</b> to make the <b>written version of the Qur'an</b>.</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">No changes made</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In preparing the written version of the Qur'an, Zaid ensured that 
								<b>not the slightest change was made</b>. Nothing was removed, nothing was added, the 
								order was preserved precisely. Zaid accepted that every word was the <b>word of Allah</b> 
								and duly recorded it in the text.</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Calligraphy</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Many editions of the Qur'an that have been produced are written in <b>beautiful calligraphy</b>. It is considered an <b>honour to copy the Qur'an</b> and the copyist would do this as beautifully as possible.
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Supreme authority</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								The Qur'an is prominent in every aspect of Muslim life and its <b>authority is supreme and unquestioned</b>. It is regarded as a <b>Holy book</b> and treated with the greatest respect. The Qur'an is <b>not to be placed on the ground</b> and should <b>not be touched unnecessarily</b>. When being read it is often placed on a low stool known as a "<b>kursi</b>".
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Protocols for the reading of the Qur'an</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								When the Qur'an is read <b>people must remain silent</b>. There is to be <b>no food or drink consumed</b> during the reading of the Qur'an and <b>all noise should be avoided</b>. Before reading from the Qur'an a person must bathe or <b>wash carefully</b> and ensure that they are properly disposed with the <b>appropriate attitude</b> to hear the word of Allah.  Women are not permitted to read from the Qur'an during the course of their monthly period.
								</div>

								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Care of the Qur'an</div>                                     
								<div class="text">When not being used the Qur'an is placed in an <b>elevated position</b> to avoid the possibility of something being placed on top of it and it is also <b>covered to prevent dust</b> from gathering on it.

								<div class="footnote">Qur'an's message</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								The message of the Qur'an is very <b>clear and unmistakable</b>. It announces the <b>Day of Judgment</b> and accompanying happiness for the faithful while the evil ones will experience the harshness of the eternal separation from Allah. 
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Monotheism</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								Among those who are condemned were any who did not embrace the key principle of the <b>one true God</b>. The Qur'an includes statements which emphasise the importance of social justice and a code for moral living.
								The Qur'an speaks respectfully of the <b>biblical prophets</b> such as Ibrahim, Musa and Isa and harshly condemns those who rejected or opposed their work. The Prophet Muhammed is regarded by Muslims to be the <b>last and the greatest of the Prophets</b> following in the tradition of the biblical prophets such as Musa and Isa.

						<h2>The Hadith</h2>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Traditions</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The term "hadith" means that which has been recounted or told. The hadith refers to the collection of traditions of the words and deeds of Muhammad. Many such traditions emerged after the death of Muhammad and these are highly respected though they are viewed separately and subordinate to the Qur'an.
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Two types of hadith</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								There are two types of hadiths. Those known as Prophetic Hadiths and those known as Sacred Hadiths. The Sacred Hadiths or Hadith Qudsi are regarded as the most important. They are believed by many Muslims to not only reveal the tradition of the Prophet Muhammad but to also convey something about the nature of Allah. 
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Hadith Qudsi</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								Hadith Qudsi are regarded as words from Allah which were communicated to Muhammad, however, unlike the Qur'an, these messages were passed on in the words of the Prophet rather than exactly as they were received from Allah.
								The sayings of Muhammad show him to be a man of great wisdom and character, compassion and mercy. He is loved and respected because of his faith in Allah and his great concern for others.
								</div> 
								</div><div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Collections of hadiths</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								After Muhammad's death there were many traditions that began to circulate in relation to his life. These traditions came to be gathered together in collections which came to be the basis for the hadiths. Two scholars from the early period of Islam are most noted for their work in the collection of hadiths. Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Bukhari is reputed to have collected 2762 hadiths while Abul Husayn Muslim ibn al- Hajjaj had a collection of 4000.
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Proliferation of hadiths</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Inevitably there was an enormous proliferation of reputed hadiths. It is estimated that within three centuries of Muhammad's death that over 600,000 hadiths were known. Clearly only a small proportion of these could be genuine and the numbers of false or dubious hadiths served to undermine confidence in the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad as a source of Islamic teaching.
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Hadith chains</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								The process of authentification of a hadith involved tracing its emergence back to someone who had actually been with the Prophet. The line of transmission is known as a chain. So checking the authenticity of a hadith meant checking the chain of transmission and confirming the validity of its origins and the integrity of its transmission.
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Cautious approach</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								It is very easy for a hadith to be altered in the process of transmission and scholars check very carefully to gauge the reliability of the hadith in question. A cautious approach was always taken in checking the hadith to avoid inadvertently falsifying the Prophets words.
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Use of hadith</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								The hadiths have proved invaluable to Muslim communities in addressing an issue which is not explicitly covered by the Qur'an. In these cases, the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad can prove to be a very useful substitute. 
								However, Muslims do not regard the hadith as sacred as they do the Qur'an. Clearly there is a considerable difference in value between the words of a human being, no matter how sublime, and the complete and unaltered word of Allah as found in the Qur'an.
