								<p><b> Outline two of the pillars of Islam and analyse their importance in the expression of faith for Muslims</b></p>
									<p><b>Explain the significance of arkan al-islam for the expression of the faith of Islam</b>
                                    </p>
									<h2>Sample Responses</h2>
											<p><b> Outline two of the pillars of Islam and analyse their importance in the expression of faith for Muslims</b></p>
							                <p> Within Islam, the practice of the faith is supported by five pillars. These pillars, known as arkan al-islam or 
											the pillars of Islam, are activities and beliefs which are regarded as foundational for all who follow Islam. Each of 
											the pillars requires both an internal or spiritual commitment together with an outward action or sign.</p>
							                <p> The last two of these pillars, namely Sawm and Hajj present significant challenges to Muslims who seek to 
											faithfully fulfill their requirement. Yet it is partly because of the difficulties associated with Sawm and Hajj 
											that their achievement is so highly regarded in Islam.</p>
							                <p> The fourth pillar of Islam involves fasting. It refers to voluntary fasting and is known as "sawm". The period of 
											fasting is for the month of Ramadan. During this period all adult Muslims who are in good health will fast for all 
											the hours of daylight. The month of Ramadan, the ninth month in the Muslim calendar is significant as the tradition 
											teaches that it is the month of the revelation of the Qu'ran to Muhammad.</p>
							                <p> The fast is to include abstinence from food, drink and all other bodily pleasures. This includes smoking 
											cigarettes and sexual activity. The intention is that food and all other physical comforts are to be avoided from 
											the first traces of sunrise until the last point of sunset. It requires considerable self discipline to complete the 
											requirements of Sawm and there is a great sense of achievement in having done so.</p>
							                <p> All Muslims who have reached the age of puberty are expected to fast. Exemptions exist for those who are ill and 
											those who are traveling, however, these are expected to replace the days lost as soon as they are able by fasting at 
											other times. Other exemptions are provided for the aged and women who are pregnant or nursing young children.</p>
							                <p> While one emphasis of sawm is on the physical denial of the body it also includes important elements relating to 
											the internal disposition and intention. The fast will be rendered worthless if the disposition of the person fasting 
											is not as it should be. There is to be a concerted effort to ensure that no evil acts are committed during the period 
											of the fast and also that evil thoughts are also avoided. "If you do not give up telling lies Allah will have no need 
											of your giving up food and drink" (Hadith).</p>
							                <p> A great deal of the value of sawm is found in the internal disposition developed by those fulfilling the 
											requirements. While the outward aspect of sawm are demanding, the inner requirements have profound significance and 
											should not be overlooked.</p>
							                <p> The breaking of the fast after sunset each day is an important part of sawm. There is a strong sense of 
											fellowship at this time and those fasting can enjoy a sense of achievement after their discipline of the day. The 
											food that is eaten to break the fast is known as "iftar". Most Muslims will eat only a small amount immediately after 
											sunset as to each large portions may cause people to feel ill. Later in the evening more substantial meals are eaten. 
											Frequently visitation among friends and relatives is an important part of breaking the fast.</p>
							                <p> Sawm has a number of important elements in its observance. It is a primary way of commemorating Ramadan and 
											honouring the occasion of the revelation of the Qu'ran. Secondly it is a time where the hunger of the person fasting 
											brings to mind the reality of poverty and where almsgiving is strongly encouraged.</p>
							                <p> In successfully completing the requirements of fasting, a Muslim learns self discipline and overcomes degrees 
											of selfishness, greed and laziness. There is also a strong spiritual element to the fasting. Many Muslims make extra 
											effort in prayer and religious learning during the month of Ramadan. Mosques hold special additional times of prayer 
											known as "tarawih".</p>
							                <p> The month of Ramadan ends with the feast of "Id-ul-Fitr" which is one of the great celebratory occasions in 
											Islam.</p>
							                <p> The fifth pillar of Islam is the pilgrimage or "hajj". Every devout Muslim male will desire to make the 
											pilgrimage to Makkah at least once in their lifetime.</p>
							                <p> The word "hajj" means to embark on a journey with a purpose. The purpose is essentially to visit the Ka'bah in 
											Makkah and worship on Mount Arafat. The pilgrimage takes place during the twelfth month of the Muslim calendar 
											"Dhul-Hijjah".</p>
							                <p> The hajj is an event for Muslims only, tourists are not allowed to attend. It is expected that the pilgrims who 
											attend will be people with the maturity and soundness of mind to understand the significance of what they are 
											undertaking. A certain degree of physical fitness is expected in order to manage the physical demands of the 
											pilgrimage.</p>
							                <p> There are various prescribed aspects undertaken by pilgrims performing the hajj. The preparation phase of the 
											hajj takes place outside of Makkah. This preparatory stage involves placing themselves in an appropriate disposition 
											or attitude. This involves a deliberate and conscious striving towards a state of purity. This attitude is known as 
											"ihram". As a sign of their preparedness all normal clothing is replaced by a simple ensemble of two white cloths, 
											one worn around the waist, the other draped over the left shoulder. Women wear a plain garment covering all but 
											their hands, their feet and their face.</p>
							                <p> As the pilgrim arrives in Makkah they begin to repeatedly pray the prayer known as "talbiyah" which is in the 
											form of a response to the call to perform the hajj. Immediately upon arriving in Makkah pilgrims go to the Ka'bah 
											and encircle it seven times. This encircling is known as "tawaf".</p>
							                <p> The next event to follow is the procession known as the "sa'y". This procession takes place between Safa and 
											Marwah and is completed seven times. This procession is based on the Qu'ranic tradition of Hajar's search for water 
											in the desert.</p>
							                <p> The next part of the hajj involves a journey to Mina which is undertaken on the 8 th day of the month of 
											Dhul-Hijjah. In Mina pebbles are hurled a pillars to symbolise the rejection of the devil and all works of evil.</p>
							                <p> After camping in Mina the journey continues to Mount Arafat. On the plain of Arafat people stand from midday 
											until sunset in a state of meditation This is known as the "wuquf" or the standing before Allah. The pilgrims then 
											climb Mount Arafat where a sermon is preached.</p>
							                <p> The pilgrimage continues, however, to Mina via Muzdalifah where night prayer is held together with a ritual 
											stoning of the devil. On the morning of 10 Dhul-Hijjah the pilgrims stand before dawn in a brief repetition of the "wuquf" before moving on towards Mina as the sun begins to rise.</p>
							                <p> In Mina the pilgrims camp for three days while offering the required sacrifice of an animal for Id-ul-Adha. 
											After this men have their heads shaved and women are required to cut their hair by at least 2.5 cm.</p>
							                <p> The hajj then returns to Makkah for another encircling of the Ka'bah as the final event of the pilgrimage. 
											Having completed the hajj Muslims are entitled to take the name Hajji or Hajjah.</p>
							                <p> Some Muslims are not able to undertake the pilgrimage themselves due to poor health, a lack of financial 
											means or unexpected and unavoidable circumstances. In these cases Muslims believe that the intention will suffice. 
											This intention, known as "niyyah" is an important element. Muslims believe that Allah judges them on their intentions 
											providing that their efforts are sincere. Therefore someone who is genuinely unable to perform the hajj need not 
											feel that they are failing in their religious duty.</p>
							                <p> In some instances, Muslims who are not able to perform the hajj seek to join the pilgrims in a symbolic way by 
											paying for someone else to attend in their place or giving to charity the money that they have saved for the hajj. 
											In the case of paying for someone else to attend in their place there is a restriction that this person must already 
											have performed the hajj on their own behalf.</p>
							                <p>Both the hajj and sawm present significant challenges to Muslims who are required to fulfill their requirements 
											as part of the five pillars of Islam The challenges, however, are seen as insignificant in the light of the benefits 
											associated with fulfilling these requirements. Each of the pillars requires both an internal or spiritual commitment 
											together with an outward action or sign. In the case of both sawm and the hajj, the physical requirements are quite 
											challenging, yet at the same time the actions need to be accompanied by an appropriate disposition in order to be 
											worthwhile. </p>
