		<h1>Summary Points </h1>
		<h3>The principal ethical teachings within Islam</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>The intention of life for a Muslim is to follow the will of Allah
		  <li>Each moment of each day is to be lived in an attitude of complete surrender or submission to Allah
		  <li>There is no aspect of life which is separate of removed from Allah's concern
		  <li>Muslims strive to bring all their actions into accord with the will of Allah
		  <li>This requires a constant awareness on the part of Muslims and being attuned to the will of God constantly in everyday life
		  <li>This awareness or consciousness is called "taqwa"
		  <li>This striving brings Muslim thought into constant contact with the field of ethics. Individuals and communities throughout the world are constantly faced with ethical decisions
		  <li>For Muslim's the principal source to guide them in ethical matters is the Qur'an
		  <li>The Qur'an is the foundational source for all teaching in Islam
		  <li>The Qur'an and it provides clear guidance in many areas
		  <li>Not all issues are addressed directly in the Qur'an
		  <li>The underlying principles expressed in the Qur'an are able to be applied in most situations
		  <li>Additional guidance for Muslims is also found in the collections of the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad known as the Hadith and Sunna
		  <li>These sources can be of considerable help in forming ethical judgments, 
		  <li>The Hadith and the Sunna do not carry the same authority as the Qur'an
		  <li>Further ethical guidance is drawn from the process of applying the principles of Islam by analogy to make appropriate judgments
		  <li>This process of making judgments is known as "qiyas"
		  <li>Qiyas refers to the working out of an issue
		  <li>Qiyas may refer to individual judgments known as "ijtihad" or to the judgment of recognised scholars which is known as "ijma"
		  <li>The overall framework operating in Islam is known as "shari'ah" 
		  <li>Shari'ah means the path
		  <li>The entire process of jurisprudence in Islam is designed to clearly set out this path so that Muslims may follow it
		  <li>A number of clear principles exist in Islamic ethics
		  <li>The first of these principles is the reality of the existence of Allah and the certainty of life after death
		  <li>This principle also includes the belief in the Day of Judgment and accountability for actions
		  <li>The next principle relates to the omniscience of Allah and the realisation that Allah is aware of the motives and actions of everyone. 
		  <li>Finally there is the realisation that the world is a place of imperfection where many evils and injustices exist
		  <li>There is no place for withdrawal and insularity in Islam
		  <li>Islam does not recognise any differences among people
		  <li>All people are equal before Allah and there is no place for privilege or favour
		  <li>This principles leads to a sense of kinship in Islam which is known as "ummah". The core ethical teaching of Islam can be summarised in five important virtues 
		  <li>The first and most fundamental of these is the love of Allah
		  <li>The second virtue relates to humility
		  <li>It requires Muslims to avoid the sense of pride and arrogance which makes them inclined to think more highly of themselves than others
		  <li>Humility will ensure that a Muslim thinks of others ahead of themselves and therefore avoids a selfish and self centered existence.
		  <li>The third virtue is modesty
		  <li>This relates most significantly to sexual ethics
		  <li>It includes the requirement to maintain appropriate standards which do not demean the opposite sex or sexual relationships
		  <li>The fourth virtue relates to that which is natural and therefore part of the design or plan of Allah
		  <li>This relates to matters of bio ethics, use of substances etc where people are expected to avoid things which artificially alter the intention of Allah's creation
		  <li>It also relates to the concern for the environment
		  <li>This requires the protection and care for the natural world and prevents environmental exploitation for selfish reasons
		  <li>The fifth virtue is that of selflessness
		  <li>This virtue governs human interaction, particularly at an economic level
		  <li>It also includes an obligation to provide material support to the poor</li>

		<h3>The process of Islamic jurisprudence</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>The most important and fundamental point of reference for Islamic jurisprudence is the Qur'an
		  <li>The Qur'an provides the teachings that are to be followed by all Muslims 
          <li>The Qur'an is regarded as normative for all aspects of Islam.
          <li>The Qur'an is very clear and direct
          <li>It is also concise and quite brief
          <li>The statements in the Qur'an are usually not sufficiently detailed to allow for direct application to some situations
          <li>Muslims also look to other sources to provide guidance for appropriate ethical actions
          <li>The process of discerning the appropriateness of actions in particular situations is known as jurisprudence
          <li>The first step in the process of discernment will always be the Qur'an
          <li>The Qur'an is also the authority that places limits on the decisions of other authorities in Islam
          <li>It is not possible for a judgment to be accepted if it clearly contravenes an aspect of the Qur'an
          <li>Beyond the Qur'an the next authorities to be consulted would be the collections of the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad known as the Hadith and the Sunna. These traditions convey the words and actions of Muhammad
          <li>Muslims consider these traditions to be particularly valuable where the Qur'an is not explicit or detailed in a given area.
          <li>The most influential of these traditions are known as the sacred hadiths or hadith qudsi
          <li>Hadith qudsi are regarded as part of the revelation of Allah communicated in the words of the Prophet rather than the exact words of Allah
          <li>The process of Islamic jurisprudence is known as fiqh which means knowledge or understanding
          <li>Fiqh refers to the process of studying shari'ah in a scholarly way, relating the legal practice to the revelation of the Qur'an and the traditions of the Prophet
          <li>The historical aspect of fiqh includes the systematic analysis of the Qur'an and Hadith in conjunction with the process of applying or working out principles through the use of analogy
          <li>The process of application of principles through analogy is known as qiyas
          <li>Qiyas is a frequently used to determine appropriate responses to the complexities of modern issues where the Qur'an and the traditions are not sufficiently clear or detailed
          <li>There are two sorts of qiyas
          <li>The first is the exercise of a personal judgment on an issue known as ijtihad
          <li>A more reliable form of qiyas is that which draws on the decisions of renowned scholars from history
          <li>These scholarly judgments are known as ijma
          <li>Ijma reflect a consensus of understanding by authorities in Islamic law
          <li>Such judgments have considerably more authority than individual judgments, however, they are not all binding
          <li>The only instances of ijma which are considered universally binding are those where the decision reflects a consensus of the companions of the Prophet
          <li>Sunni Muslims place particular value on the consensus of the scholars who are regarded as having sufficient expertise to exercise legitimate ijtihad
          <li>Such ijma reflected in this consensus is assumed to be divinely inspired and therefore binding
          <li>In the Shi'ia communities there is a particular weight given to the judgments of certain recognised authorities known either as mujtahids or ayatollahs
          <li>These act in the roles of leading Imams in the Shi'ia communities and are believed to be able to exercise ijtihad wisely and with authority. 
          <li>Therefore among the Shi'ia communities, the judgments of such authorities carry binding force.
          <li>The historical aspects of Islamic jurisprudence have been most pronounced in the development of scholarship with the specific purpose of developing detailed formulations of Islamic law
          <li>These schools were known as madhhabs
          <li>There were five main schools which have had enduring influence. 
          <li>Each was named after the leading scholars; Jafar al-Sadiq, Malik, Abu Hanifa, Shafi'i and Ahmad ibn Hanbal
          <li>Most Muslim communities today would follow one or other of these schools

		<h3>The importance of ethical teachings in determining that which is halal and haraam</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>Muslim ethical judgment ultimately leads to a decision about what is permitted or halal and what is forbidden or haraam
		  <li>In principle if something is not forbidden then it is permitted
		  <li>Because something is permitted does not mean that it should be done
		  <li>In living Shari'ah and making decisions about what should be done a number of aspects need to be considered
		  <li>The first is to consider the views of respected people and leaders in the community
		  <li>If the consensus of these respected people is against doing something then it would be wise to avoid it, even if it were not haraam
		  <li>The second aspect is to look at the precedent of previous decisions
		  <li>In all but a few cases there will have been similar circumstances faced in the past and the precedents of the decisions taken should strongly guide the response to the present situation
		  <li>The third aspect is that of the common or public good
		  <li>This involves the welfare of others and an overall concern for justice
		  <li>An action which is not forbidden may still be evidently harmful to many people in the given situation and accordingly should be avoided
		  <li>Some things are regarded as forbidden (haraam) and should never be done
		  <li>Permitted or halal actions fall under a number of categories or levels
		  <li>The most important are those things which are required actions or behaviours. Those things which are required actions are known as fard or wajib
		  <li>For most Muslims, fard and wajib are identical
		  <li>In some schools of thought fard refers to obligations stemming from revelation while wajib refers to obligations stemming from reason
		  <li>The second level of halal actions are known as mandub or mustahab
		  <li>These are actions that are desirable or recommended
		  <li>The third level of halal actions are known as mubah
		  <li>These actions fall into the realm of the unclear and require the prudent exercise of personal judgment
		  <li>Mubah refers to situations where there is no clear guidance in the Qur'an or in judgments of authorities in Islam
		  <li>In these situations an individual must choose the correct action based on the principles outlined above
		  <li>The final level of halal actions are those which are not recommended or are not approved
		  <li>These actions are known as makruh and are officially regarded as hateful, yet are not absolutely forbidden
		  <li>These actions should be avoided when ever possible</li>
