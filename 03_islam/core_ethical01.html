						<h2>The principal ethical teaching within Islam</h2>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Submission to Allah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The intention of life for a Muslim is to follow, as closely as possible, the will of Allah. Each moment of each day is to be lived in an attitude of complete <strong>surrender or submission to Allah</strong>. This is what it means to be a Muslim</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Taqwa</div>                                     
								<div class="text">There is no aspect of life which is separate of removed from Allah's concern and therefore all actions strive to bring all their actions into accord with the <strong>will of Allah</strong>. This requires a constant awareness on the part of Muslims and being attuned to the will of God constantly in everyday life. This<strong> awareness or consciousness is called "taqwa"</strong>.</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Striving</div>                                     
								<div class="text">A Muslim will strive constantly to find the best way to live and the best way to<strong> respond to the will of Allah</strong>. This striving brings Muslim thought into constant contact with the field of ethics. Individuals and communities throughout the world are constantly faced with <strong>ethical decisions</strong>. That is, having to find the best or the right way if acting in response to issues faced in the course of human experience. 
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Qur'an</div>                                     
								<div class="text">For Muslim's the <strong>principal source</strong> to guide them in ethical matters is the Qur'an. It is the foundational source for all teaching in Islam and it provides clear guidance in many areas. Not all issues are addressed directly in the Qur'an, however, the <strong>underlying principles</strong> are able to be applied in most situations.
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Hadith and Sunna</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Additional guidance for Muslims is also found in the <strong>collections of the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad</strong> known as the <strong>Hadith</strong> and <strong>Sunna</strong>. While these sources can be of considerable help in forming ethical judgments, it is important to note that they do not carry the same authority as the Qur'an.
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Qiyas</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Further ethical guidance is drawn from the process of applying the principles of Islam <strong>by analogy</strong> to make appropriate judgments. This process of making judgments is known as "<strong>qiyas</strong>". It refers to the working out of an issue. It may refer to individual judgments known as "<strong>ijtihad</strong>" or to the judgment of recognised scholars which is known as "<strong>ijma</strong>".
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Shari'ah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The overall framework operating in Islam is known as "<strong>shari'ah</strong>" <strong>which means the path</strong>. The entire process of jurisprudence in Islam is designed to clearly set out this path so that Muslims may follow it.
								<p>Despite the complexities of some ethical issues, there are, nonetheless, a number of clear principles in Islamic ethics which are to be followed. When applied these become the core ethical teachings of Islam.
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Existence of Allah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The first of these principles is the <strong>reality of the existence of Allah</strong> <strong>and the certainty of life after death</strong>. This principle also includes the belief in the Day of Judgment and accountability for actions. The next principle relates to the omniscience of Allah and the realisation that Allah is aware of the motives and actions of everyone. Finally there is the realisation that the world is a place of imperfection where many evils and injustices exist. Muslims have an obligation to address these issues. There is no place for withdrawal and insularity in Islam.
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">All are equal before Allah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Islam does not recognise any differences among people. All people are <strong>equal before Allah</strong> and there is <strong>no place for privilege or favour</strong>. This principle also demands that the least desirable and most vulnerable in society are given the same care and attention as those who are more highly thought of in secular terms.
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Ummah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">This principles leads to a <strong>sense of kinship</strong> in Islam which is known as "<strong>ummah</strong>". This is variously described in terms of communal responsibilities, family like ties etc. Perhaps the best understanding of the strength of idea is when it is related to the maternal responsibility a mother feels for her child.
								<p>The core ethical teaching of Islam can be summarised in five important virtues which draw on essential moral characteristics expected of Muslims. 
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Love of Allah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The first and most fundamental of these is the love of Allah. This virtue sums up all other principles and ideas in Islam. Properly understood this virtue could stand alone as the basis of ethical teaching in Islam.
								<p>In reality, if all human beings lived faithfully by this principle, no other teaching would be required. It would lead to people recognising and acknowledging the kinship that exists between them. It would lead people to be constantly aware of the rights of others and be prepared to defend those rights. Finally it would lead to people living in order to do good to others rather than for selfish reasons.
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Humility</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The second virtue relates to humility. It requires Muslims to avoid the <strong>sense of pride and arrogance</strong> which makes them inclined to think more highly of themselves than others. Humility will ensure that a Muslim thinks of others ahead of themselves and therefore avoids a selfish and self centered existence.
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Modesty</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The third virtue is modesty. This relates most significantly to <strong>sexual ethics</strong>. It includes the requirement to maintain <strong>appropriate standards</strong> which do not demean the opposite sex or sexual relationships. Any kind of inappropriate behaviour in the area of sexuality is prevented through the virtue of modesty.
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Naturalness</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The fourth virtue relates to <strong>that which is natural</strong> and therefore part of the design or <strong>plan of Allah</strong>. At one level this relates to matters of bio ethics, use of substances etc where people are expected to avoid things which artificially alter the intention of Allah's creation. Scientific developments should work to enhance the beauty and integrity of creation rather than duplicating it or substituting it. 
								<p>Another aspect of the virtue of naturalness is the <strong>concern for the environment</strong>. This requires the protection and care for the natural world and prevents environmental exploitation for selfish reasons.
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Selflessness</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The fifth virtue is that of selflessness. This virtue governs <strong>human interaction</strong>, particularly at an economic level. It prevents the situation where one person is exploited by others for economic gain such as the charging of interest on loans, the payment of unjust wages etc. It also includes an obligation to provide <strong>material support to the poor.
