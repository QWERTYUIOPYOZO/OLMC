	    <h1>Summary Points</h1>
		<h3>The five pillars</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>The practice of the faith is supported by five pillars. </li>
          <li>Arkan al-islam (the pillars of Islam) are activities and beliefs which are regarded as foundational for all who follow Islam. </li>
		  <li>Each of the pillars requires both an internal or spiritual commitment together with an outward action or sign.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Shahada</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>The first pillar is a witness to the oneness of Allah and the role of the Prophet Muhammad as its messenger. </li>
          <li>Shahada means to bear witness. </li>
          <li>The witness in the shahada is essentially all that it takes to be considered a Muslim. </li>
          <li>It is a declaration that Muslims pray ceaselessly in everyday life. </li>
          <li>Muslims seek to pray the shahada each morning upon waking and each night before sleeping. </li>
          <li>The shahada is whispered into the ear of a newly born child. </li>
          <li>It is part of the call to prayer proclaimed by the muezzin, it forms part of ritual prayer, prayers offered during pilgrimage and at the hour of death of a believer. </li>
          <li>The shahada witnesses to the monotheism of Islam. </li>
		  <li>Includes a repudiation of anything which falsely claims to be God.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Salat</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>The second of the pillars of Islam is the requirement of ritual prayer known as &ldquo;salat&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>Every Muslim must offer five daily prayers. </li>
          <li>On Friday prayers are offered at noon at the mosque. </li>
          <li>There are also prayers to be offered on the great </li>
          <li>Individual ritual prayers are usually said in private. </li>
          <li>The prayers are recited in Arabic and are accompanied by prescribed ritual actions or bodily postures. </li>
          <li>These actions are known as &ldquo;rak&rsquo;ahs&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>It is expected that a Muslim would be in a state of ritual purity before offering the prayers. </li>
          <li>Ritual ablutions are carried out before praying </li>
          <li>Prayer is offered on clean ground </li>
          <li>The worshipper faces towards Mecca in order to pray. </li>
          <li>The five times of daily ritual prayer required by salat extend throughout the day from sunrise until well after sunset. </li>
          <li>The first payer is dawn prayer known as &ldquo;al-fajr&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>The second prayer is known as &ldquo;al-zuhr&rdquo; which is noon prayer. </li>
          <li>The third payer is offered mid way through the afternoon. It is known as &ldquo;al-`asr&rdquo;. The fourth prayer, is offered immediately after sunset and is called &ldquo;al-maghrib&rdquo;. The fifth and final prayer is known as &ldquo;al-`isha&rdquo; and is repeated four times around one and a half hours after sunset. </li>
          <li>The ritual prayers are an act of obedience to Allah. </li>
          <li>They proclaim the oneness and greatness of Allah. </li>
          <li>The prayers serve the function of bringing people closer to Allah </li>
		  <li>They contribute to the purity of the person praying, provide strength to carry out the requirements of Islam and forgiveness for transgressions.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Zakat</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>The third pillar of Islam is the requirement of almsgiving known as &ldquo;zakat&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>Zakat operates as a tithe where money is collected from Muslims and given to the poor. </li>
          <li>In some traditional Muslim societies such as Saudi Arabia, it is part of the practice of government. </li>
          <li>In other places zakat is a matter for individual Muslims and their communities. </li>
          <li>The amount that is expected to be given is generally calculated as 2 &frac12;% of a person&rsquo;s income </li>
          <li>There are many special categories that apply where the expected amount is varied. </li>
          <li>This is particularly the case with regard to agricultural produce and livestock. </li>
          <li>Zakat is a provision within the Muslim community for the needs of the poor among the Muslims. </li>
          <li>Its purpose is not to provide for the needs of the poor generally. </li>
          <li>This is the function of general charitable work or almsgiving which is referred to as &ldquo;sadaqah&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>Zakat is not intended to replace the general provision of charity. </li>
          <li>The money can only be used for certain clearly defined purposes. </li>
          <li>These are concerned with helping the poor </li>
          <li>May also include freeing people from debt, assisting travelers in need and setting people free from bonded labour or slavery. </li>
          <li>There is also provision for work which is aimed at converting people to Islam </li>
          <li>Also to provide for the livelihood of those who collect the zakat offerings. </li>
          <li>The aim of zakat for the one contributing is to purify and cleanse wealth </li>
          <li>Anything given is understood as simply returning the material goods to their rightful owner. </li>
          <li>Wealth and material possessions are understood to be transient things. </li>
          <li>People are born into the world without possessions, they will leave the world without possessions </li>
          <li>People are expected to give without anyone knowing the amount they have contributed. </li>
		  <li>This provision is intended to overcome the temptation to give in order to receive the praise or admiration of others.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Sawm</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>The fourth pillar of Islam involves voluntary fasting and is known as &ldquo;sawm&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>The period of fasting is for the month of Ramadan. </li>
          <li>During this period all adult Muslims who are in good health will fast for all the hours of daylight. </li>
          <li>The month of Ramadan, the ninth month in the Muslim calendar </li>
          <li>The tradition teaches that it is the month of the revelation of the Qu&rsquo;ran to Muhammad. </li>
          <li>The fast is to include abstinence from food, drink and all other bodily pleasures. This includes smoking cigarettes and sexual activity. </li>
          <li>The intention is that food and all other physical comforts are to be avoided from the first traces of sunrise until the last point of sunset. </li>
          <li>All Muslims who have reached the age of puberty are expected to fast. Exemptions exist for those who are ill and those who are traveling, however, these are expected to replace the days lost as soon as they are able </li>
          <li>Other exemptions are provided for the aged and women who are pregnant or nursing young children. </li>
          <li>Sawm also includes important elements relating to the internal disposition and intention. </li>
          <li>The fast will be rendered worthless if the disposition of the person fasting is not as it should be. </li>
          <li>There is to be a concerted effort to ensure that no evil acts are committed during the period of the fast and also that evil thoughts are also avoided </li>
          <li>The breaking of the fast after sunset each day is an important part of sawm. There is a strong sense of fellowship. </li>
          <li>The food that is eaten to break the fast is known as &ldquo;iftar&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>Sawm helps to teach self discipline and overcomes degrees of selfishness, greed and laziness. </li>
          <li>There is also a strong spiritual element to the fasting. </li>
          <li>Many Muslims make extra effort in prayer and religious learning during the month of Ramadan. </li>
          <li>Mosques hold special additional times of prayer known as &ldquo;tarawih&rdquo;. </li>
		  <li>The month of Ramadan ends with the feast of &ldquo;Id-ul-Fitr&rdquo; which is one of the great celebratory occasions in Islam.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Hajj</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>The fifth pillar of Islam is the pilgrimage or &ldquo;hajj&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>Every devout Muslim seeks to make the pilgrimage to Makkah at least once in their lifetime. </li>
          <li>The word &ldquo;hajj&rdquo; means to embark on a journey with a purpose. </li>
          <li>The purpose is to visit the Ka&rsquo;bah in Makkah and worship on Mount Arafat. </li>
          <li>The pilgrimage takes place during the twelfth month of the Muslim calendar &ldquo;Dhul-Hijjah&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>The individual not only needs to provide for their own needs on the pilgrimage but they also need to provide for the needs of their family while they are away. Over a million people gather annually in Saudi Arabia for the hajj. </li>
          <li>Those undertaking the hajj are organised into groups under the guidance of an experienced hajj guide who is able to ensure that the proper protocols are followed. </li>
          <li>The hajj is an event for Muslims only </li>
          <li>It is expected that the pilgrims who attend will be people with the maturity and soundness of mind to understand the significance of what they are undertaking. </li>
          <li>A certain degree of physical fitness is expected in order to manage the physical demands of the pilgrimage. </li>
          <li>Some Muslims are not able to undertake the pilgrimage themselves due to poor health, a lack of financial means or unexpected and unavoidable circumstances. In these cases Muslims believe that the intention will suffice. </li>
          <li>This intention is as &ldquo;niyyah&rdquo; </li>
          <li>Muslims believe that Allah judges them on their intentions providing that their efforts are sincere. </li>
          <li>In some instances, Muslims who are not able to perform the hajj seek to join the pilgrims in a symbolic way by paying for someone else to attend in their place or giving to charity the money that they have saved for the hajj </li>
          <li>There are various prescribed aspects undertaken by pilgrims performing the hajj. The preparation phase of the hajj takes place outside of Makkah. </li>
          <li>This preparatory stage involves placing themselves in an appropriate disposition or attitude. </li>
          <li>This involves a deliberate and conscious striving towards a state of purity. </li>
          <li>This attitude is known as &ldquo;ihram&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>As a sign of their preparedness all normal clothing is replaced by a simple ensemble of two white cloths, one worn around the waist, the other draped over the left shoulder. </li>
          <li>Women wear a plain garment covering all but their hands, their feet and their face. </li>
          <li>As the pilgrim arrives in Makkah they begin to repeatedly pray the prayer known as &ldquo;talbiyah&rdquo; </li>
          <li>Immediately upon arriving in Makkah pilgrims go to the Ka&rsquo;bah and encircle it seven times. </li>
          <li>This encircling is known as &ldquo;tawaf&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>The next event to follow is the procession known as the &ldquo;sa&rsquo;y&rdquo;. </li>
          <li>This procession takes place between Safa and Marwah and is completed seven times. </li>
          <li>This procession is based on the Qu&rsquo;ranic tradition of Hajar&rsquo;s search for water in the desert. </li>
          <li>The next part of the hajj involves a journey to Mina. </li>
          <li>In Mina pebbles are hurled a pillars to symbolise the rejection of the devil </li>
          <li>After camping in Mina the journey continues to Mount Arafat. </li>
          <li>On the plain of Arafat people stand from midday until sunset in a state of meditation </li>
          <li>This is known as the &ldquo;wuquf&rdquo; or the standing before Allah. </li>
          <li>The pilgrims then climb Mount Arafat where a sermon is preached. </li>
          <li>The pilgrimage continues to Mina via Muzdalifah where night prayer is held </li>
          <li>On the morning of 10 Dhul-Hijjah the pilgrims stand before dawn in a brief repetition of the &ldquo;wuquf&rdquo; before moving on towards Mina as the sun begins to rise. </li>
          <li>In Mina the pilgrims camp for three days while offering the required sacrifice of an animal for Id-ul-Adha. </li>
          <li>After this men have their heads shaved and women are required to cut their hair by at least 2.5 cm. </li>
          <li>The hajj then returns to Makkah for another encircling of the Ka&rsquo;bah as the final event of the pilgrimage. </li>
		  <li>Having completed the hajj Muslims are entitled to take the name Hajji or Hajjah.</li>
