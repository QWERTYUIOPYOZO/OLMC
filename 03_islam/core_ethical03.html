																<h1>Content Description</h1>
									<h3>The importance of ethical teachings in determining that which is:</h3>
									<ul><li>halal
									<li>haraam
									</li></ul>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Halal and Haraam</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Muslim ethical judgment ultimately leads to a decision about what is <strong>permitted</strong> or <strong>halal</strong> and what is <strong>forbidden</strong> or <strong>haraam</strong>. In principle if something is not forbidden then it is permitted. However, simply because something is permitted does not mean that it should be done.
								<p>In living Shari'ah and making decisions about what should be done a number of aspects need to be considered.
								</div> 
							  </div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Respected leaders</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The first is to consider the <strong>views of respected people</strong> and leaders in the community. If the <strong>consensus of these</strong> respected people is against doing something then it would be wise to avoid it, even if it were not haraam.
								</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Precedent</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The second aspect is to look at the <strong>precedent of previous</strong> <strong>decisions</strong>. In all but a few cases there will have been similar circumstances faced in the past and the precedents of the decisions taken should strongly guide the response to the present situation. 
								<p>There is of course need for <strong>prudent application</strong> of these precedents as two situations which appear the same on the surface may in fact be quite different in their context.
								</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Common or public good</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The third aspect is that of the <strong>common or public good</strong>, the welfare of others and an overall concern for justice. An action which is not forbidden may still be evidently harmful to many people in the given situation and accordingly should be avoided.
								<p>With these aspects in mind it is possible to make a prudent judgment on the situation. This judgment is essentially a decision about whether a permitted action is a prudent or desirable one.
								</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Haraam</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Some things are regarded as <strong>forbidden (haraam)</strong> and <strong>should never be done</strong>. These include things such as adultery which can never be regarded as a permissible action regardless of the circumstances.
								<p>As noted, if something is not forbidden then it is permitted, however, because something is permitted it does not necessarily mean that it is desirable or appropriate. In the realm of the things that are permitted or things that are halal, there are a number of categories or levels.
								</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Required actions</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The most important are those things which are <strong>required actions or behaviours</strong>. Examples of these would include the <strong>five pillars</strong>. Those things which are required actions are known as <strong>fard or wajib</strong>. For most Muslims, fard and wajib are identical, however in some schools of thought fard refers to obligations stemming from revelation while wajib refers to obligations stemming from reason.
								<p>Fard and wajib can be identified in two forms. One involves a personal obligation while the second is an obligation on the Muslim community as a whole.
							</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Desirable actions</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								The second level of halal actions are known as<strong> mandub or mustahab</strong>. These are actions that are <strong>desirable or recommended</strong>. Additional charitable activities or prayers, gestures of hospitality, forgiving wrongdoing etc are all regarded as mandub or mustahab.
								</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Unclear actions</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								The third level of halal actions are known as <strong>mubah</strong>. These actions fall into the realm of the unclear and require the <strong>prudent exercise of personal judgment</strong>. Mubah refers to situations where there is no clear guidance in the Qur'an or in judgments of authorities in Islam. In these situations an individual must choose the correct action based on the principles outlined above.
								</div> 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Hateful actions</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The final level of halal actions are those which are <strong>not recommended or are not approved</strong>. These actions are known as makruh and are officially <strong>regarded as hateful</strong>, yet are not absolutely forbidden. These actions should be avoided when ever possible. Ending a marriage through divorce is an example of makruh.
