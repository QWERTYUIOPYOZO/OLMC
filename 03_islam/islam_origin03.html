									<h1>Content Description</h1>
						<h2>The Prophet Muhammad as the final messenger is the model for Muslim life.</h2>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Example of surrender to the will of Allah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								The word <strong>"Islam" means surrender</strong> and its meaning reflects the disposition sought after by all devout Muslims, namely surrender to the will of Allah. The Prophet Muhammad is regarded as the sublime <strong>example of surrender to the will of Allah</strong> and accordingly is seen by Muslims as a model for life.
								<p>There is no sense in Islam that Muhammad is other than a human being. Despite various legends and extraordinary events that surrounded his life, he was, nonetheless, human. Great care is taken in Islam to ensure that respect for the Prophet Muhammad does not become a form of worship. <strong>Worship is for Allah only</strong>.
								<p>This caution is expressed in the Qur'an "Muhammad is but a messenger; there have been many prophets before him, and they all died. (surah 3:144).
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">tradition of the Prophets</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The idea of Muhammad as the <strong>final messenger</strong> reflects the understanding in Islam that the he stands in the long tradition of the <strong>prophets proclaiming the one true God</strong>. Most esteemed among these messengers are <strong>Ibrahim, Musa and Isa</strong>. Muslims believe that with the Prophet Muhammad, the process of revelation has culminated and accordingly he is to be regarded as the last of the prophets or the <strong>final messenger of Allah</strong>.
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Hadith and Sunna</div>                                     
								<div class="text">There are a number of aspects of Muhammad's life which give witness to his total submission to the will of Allah and therefore provide <strong>important guides for Muslims to follow</strong>. The<strong> traditions</strong> of the actions of Muhammad are recorded in the <strong>Sunna</strong> while the traditions of Muhammad's teachings are recorded in the <strong>Hadith</strong>. Both these sources are helpful for Muslims in appreciating the significance of the Prophet's life and actions.

								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Wise and capable leader</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In Muhammad's early life there is evidence that he was a <strong>wise and capable leader</strong>. He quickly earned the trust and respect of his uncle Abu Talib and soon after of the widow Khadija. Both found him to be<strong> trustworthy, reliable and capable</strong> in business affairs.
								<p>Even before receiving the revelation from the angel Jibril, Muhammad was living a life characterised by prayer and spiritual searching. He regularly took himself away for long periods of solitude and reflection.
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Faith, trust and patience</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Upon receiving the revelation from Jibril, Muhammad displayed a number of characteristics which are important for Muslims to develop. Firstly he <strong>showed faith</strong> and was prepared to place his <strong>trust in the word of Allah</strong> despite not knowing where it would lead. Secondly, he showed patience in waiting for the time to begin preaching. Although he experienced normal anxiety and uncertainty at this time he nevertheless <strong>surrendered his will to Allah and waited</strong>.
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Fearless preacher</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
Finally when he was given the command to <strong>preach the message </strong>he did so <strong>tirelessly and fearlessly</strong>. Muhammad encountered great opposition among the people of Makkah. He was <strong>ridiculed and persecuted</strong> for his words. The requirements of the message created great hostility towards him, particularly from those in Makkah who made their wealth from the exploitation of the worship of idols and the cult of the Ka'bah.

								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">trust in Allah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Muhammad was once again required to<strong> trust Allah</strong> in the decision to <strong>travel to Madinah (Yathrib)</strong>. This was a perilous undertaking which put his life at risk, however, Muhammad recognised the importance of the commitment people of Yathrib had made to place Allah before all else.</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Prudent and just leader</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								As a leader in Madinah, the Prophet Muhammad showed himself to be <strong>prudent and just</strong>. His rule was highlighted by <strong>practical wisdom</strong> such as the importance of forgiveness and overcoming anger. It also included elements of <strong>integrity and fair dealing</strong> such as the prompt payment of wages and avoidance of corruption. Further elements included codes for <strong>sexual morality</strong> as well as a reformist <strong>social agenda</strong> which addressed issues such as infanticide, respect for women and the abuse of slaves.</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Care for the poor</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Finally, the community under Muhammad's leadership had a clear responsibility to <strong>care for its most vulnerable members</strong>. The Prophet Muhammad ensured that the community followed practices where the <strong>poor were supported</strong> by the offerings of all Muslims and not left destitute as would have been the case in most communities of the time.</div>
