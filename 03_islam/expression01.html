									<h1>Syllabus Requirements</h1>                                 
							  			<div class="content2">
							    <h2>The five pillars </h2>
								<div class="footnote">arkan al-islam</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Within Islam, the practice of the faith is supported by five pillars. These pillars, 
								  known as <b>arkan al-islam (the pillars of Islam)</b> are activities and beliefs 
								  which are regarded as <b>foundational for all who follow Islam</b>. Each of the 
								  pillars requires both <b>an internal or spiritual commitment</b> together with 
								  an <b>outward action or sign</b>.</p>
						        </div> 
								
								<h2>Shahada</h2>
								<div class="footnote">bear witness </div>                                     
								<div class="text"> The first of the five pillars is a <b>witness to the oneness of Allah</b> and the role 
								  of the Prophet Muhammad as its messenger. This pillar is known as the shahada which means 
								  to bear witness.</p>
							      <p>The shahada is expressed as follows "Ashadu an la ilaha il-allahu wa Muhammadar rasullah". 
								  It means "I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger 
							    of Allah".</p></div> 
								<div class="footnote">essential requirement of Islam</div>
								<div class="text">The <b>witness in the shahada</b> is essentially all that it takes to be 
								  <b>considered a Muslim</b>. It is a declaration that Muslims <b>pray 
								  ceaselessly</b> in everyday life. Muslims seek to pray the shahada <b>each 
								  morning</b> upon waking and <b>each night</b> before sleeping. The shahada 
								  is whispered into the ear of a <b>newly born child</b>. It is part of the 
								  <b>call to prayer</b> proclaimed by the muezzin, it forms part of <b>ritual 
								  prayer</b> and underpins prayers offered <b>during pilgrimage</b> and at the 
								  <b>hour of death</b> of a believer.</p>
							    </div>
								<div class="footnote">monotheism of Islam</div>
								<div class="text"> The shahada essentially witnesses to the <b>monotheism of Islam</b>. Its 
								  central statement affirms the <b>oneness of Allah</b> and expressed in the 
								  negative "there is no god but Allah" provides not only an affirmation of the 
								  oneness of Allah but also includes a <b>repudiation of anything which falsely claims 
								  to be God</b>. The repudiation of anything false includes a repudiation of self and 
								  selfishness which frees a Muslim to worship Allah freely without the restrictions of 
								  egocentrism.</p>
							      <p>In everyday life the witness to the oneness of Allah has important implications for 
								  Muslims. It conveys an element which prevents Muslims from submitting to authorities or 
								  decrees which contravene the principles of Islam. </p>
								</div>
								<h2>Salat</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Five daily prayers</div>
								<div class="text"> The second of the pillars of Islam is the requirement of <b>ritual prayer</b> 
								  known as <b>"salat".</b> The requirement here is that every Muslim 
								  will offer <b>five daily prayers</b>. In addition, prayers are offered on 
								  <b>Fridays at noon at the mosque</b>. There are also prayers to be offered on 
								  the great festivals and on other significant occasions.</p>
						        </div>
								<div class="footnote">Private prayer</div>
								<div class="text">In carrying out the requirement of salat, <b>individual ritual prayers are said in 
								  private</b>. Sometimes Muslims do gather in mosques for such prayers, however, this is 
								  not necessary to meet the requirements of salat. The prayers are <b>recited in 
								  Arabic</b> and are accompanied by prescribed <b>ritual actions or bodily 
								  postures</b>. These actions are known as <b>"rak'ahs".</b> 
								  They are a sequence of movements which follow a set pattern and accompany the prayers.</p>
						        </div>
								<div class="footnote">Ritual purity</div>
								<div class="text"> It is expected that a Muslim would be in a state of <b>ritual purity before 
								  offering the prayers</b>. Therefore, <b>ritual ablutions</b> are carried 
								  out which include the feet, forearms, hands, face and head, mouth and nose.</p>
								  <p> Prayer is offered on <b>clean ground</b> with the Muslim usually removing 
								  his or her shoes. A small piece of carpet or <b>prayer mat</b> is often placed 
								  on the ground to ensure its cleanliness. The worshipper <b>faces towards Makkah</b> 
								  in order to pray. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="footnote">Prayer throughout the day</div>
								<div class="text">The five times of daily ritual prayer required by salat extend throughout the day 
								  <b>from sunrise until well after sunset</b>. On each occasion there is a 
								  prescribed prayer which is substantially repeated with minimal variations two, three or 
								  four times.</p>
							    </div>
								<div class="footnote">The form of the prayers</div>
								<div class="text"> The first prayer is <b>dawn prayer</b> which is repeated twice. This prayer is 
								  known as <b>"al-fajr".</b> The second prayer is known as 
								  <b>"al-zuhr"</b> which is <b>noon prayer</b>. This prayer 
								  is repeated four times when the sun has reached its highest point in the sky. The third 
								  prayer is offered <b>mid way through the afternoon</b>. It is known as 
								  <b>"al-`asr"</b> and is repeated four times. The next prayer, 
								  the fourth, is offered <b>immediately after sunset</b> and is called 
								  <b>"al-maghrib".</b> It is repeated three times. The fifth and 
								  final prayer is known as <b>"al-`isha"</b> and is repeated four 
								  times around <b>one and a half hours after sunset.</b></p>
							    </div>
								<div class="footnote">importance of Salat</div>
								<div class="text">The ritual prayers of salat play an important role in Islam at a number of different 
								  levels. Firstly they are an <b>act of obedience</b> to Allah. Secondly 
								  they <b>proclaim the oneness and greatness of Allah</b>. The prayers also serve 
								  the function of <b>bringing people closer to Allah</b>, they contribute to 
								  the <b>purity of the person praying</b>, <b>provide strength</b> to 
								  carry out the requirements of Islam and <b>forgiveness for transgressions.</b></p>
							    </div>
								 
								<h2>Zakat</h2>
								<div class="footnote">charitable tax</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> The third pillar of Islam is the requirement of <b>almsgiving</b> 
								known as <b>"zakat".</b> Zakat operates as a kind of tithe where money 
								is collected from Muslims and given to the poor. It has also been described as a 
								<b>charitable tax</b>.</div>
								<div class="footnote">State provision</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In some traditional Muslim societies such as Saudi Arabia, it is part of 
								the <b>practice of government.</b> In other places zakat is a matter for 
								<b>individual Muslims and their communities</b>.</div>
								<div class="footnote">prescribed amounts</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> The amount that is expected to be given in fulfilling the requirement of 
								zakat is generally calculated as <b>2 1/2% of a person's income</b>, 
								however, there are many special categories that apply where the expected amount is varied. 
								This is particularly the case with regard to agricultural produce and livestock.</div>
								<div class="footnote">support for poor Muslims</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Zakat is understood as a provision within the Muslim community for the 
								<b>needs of the poor among the Muslims</b>. Its purpose is not to provide for the 
								needs of the poor generally. This is the function of general charitable work or almsgiving 
								which is referred to as "sadaqah". Zakat is not intended to replace the general 
								provision of charity. The exceptions to this situation relate to the almsgiving associated with 
								Ramadan and Al'fitr.</div>
								<div class="footnote">clearly defined purposes</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> The money contributed through zakat can only be used for certain 
								<b>clearly defined purposes</b>. Primarily these purposes are concerned with 
								helping the poor but can also include freeing people from debt, assisting travelers in need 
								and setting people free from bonded labour or slavery. There is also provision for work 
								which is aimed at converting people to Islam and to provide for the livelihood of those who 
								collect the zakat offerings.</div>
								<div class="footnote">Purification and cleansing of wealth</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The aim of zakat for the one contributing is to <b>purify and cleanse 
								wealth</b> and to allow it to be <b>free from greed and selfishness</b>. It 
								helps Muslims to overcome feelings of attachment to money and the wish to cling to it. It 
								affirms that money is for the service of human kind and not for exclusive personal gain.</div>
								<div class="footnote">on trust from Allah</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> Muslims believe that the things they own; their wealth and possessions, are 
								<b>not truly their own</b> but rather in trust to them by Allah. Thus anything they 
								give is understood as <b>simply returning the material goods to their rightful owner. 
								</b>They also believe that it is Allah's choice for people to be rich and poor and 
								that the rich have an obligation to help the poor which goes beyond the notion of charity.</div>
								<div class="footnote">transience of wealth</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Wealth and material possessions are understood to be <b>transient 
								things</b>. People are <b>born</b> into the world <b>without 
								possessions</b>, they will <b>leave</b> the world <b>without 
								possessions</b> and therefore it is foolishness to cling to possessions and even 
								worse to be dominated by them.</div>
								<div class="footnote">giving is to be done discreetly</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> People are expected to <b>give without anyone knowing</b> the 
								amount they have contributed. This provision is intended to overcome the temptation to 
								give in order to receive the praise or admiration of others. When people <b>give 
								selflessly</b> they believe they will receive blessings from Allah well beyond the 
								value of what they have given. However, these blessings are not understood in material 
								terms.</div>
								
								<h2>Sawm</h2>
								<div class="footnote">Fasting during Ramadan</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The fourth pillar of Islam involves <b>fasting</b>. It refers to 
								voluntary fasting and is known as <b>"sawm".</b> The period of fasting 
								is for the <b>month of Ramadan</b>. During this period all adult Muslims who are in 
								good health will fast for <b>all the hours of daylight</b>. The month of Ramadan, 
								the ninth month in the Muslim calendar is significant as the tradition teaches that it is 
								the <b>month of the revelation of the Qu'ran to Muhammad</b>.</div>
								<div class="footnote">Sunrise to sunset</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> The fast is to include <b>abstinence from food, drink and all other 
								bodily pleasures</b>. This includes smoking cigarettes and sexual activity. The 
								intention is that food and all other physical comforts are to be avoided from the 
								<b>first traces of sunrise until the last point of sunset</b>.</div>
								<div class="footnote">All able adults to fast</div>                                     
								<div class="text">All Muslims who have reached the <b>age of puberty</b> are 
								expected to fast. Exemptions exist for <b>those who are ill and those who are 
								traveling</b>, however, these are expected to replace the days lost as soon as they 
								are able by fasting at other times. Other exemptions are provided for the <b>aged and 
								women who are pregnant or nursing young children</b>.</div>
								<div class="footnote">internal disposition</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> While one emphasis of sawm is on the <b>physical denial of the 
								body</b> it also includes important elements relating to the <b>internal 
								disposition and intention</b>. The fast will be rendered worthless if the disposition 
								of the person fasting is not as it should be. There is to be a concerted effort to ensure 
								that <b>no evil acts</b> are committed during the period of the fast and also 
								that <b>evil thoughts are also avoided</b>. "If you do not give up telling 
								lies Allah will have no need of your giving up food and drink" (Hadith).</div>
								<div class="footnote">breaking of the fast</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The <b>breaking of the fast</b> after sunset each day is an 
								<b>important part of sawm.</b> There is a <b>strong sense of 
								fellowship</b> at this time and those fasting can enjoy a <b>sense of 
								achievement</b> after their discipline of the day. The food that is eaten to break 
								the fast is known as <b>"iftar".</b> Most Muslims will eat only a 
								small amount immediately after sunset as to each large portions may cause people to feel 
								ill. Later in the evening more substantial meals are eaten. Frequently <b>visitation 
								among friends and relatives</b> is an important part of breaking the fast.</div>
								<div class="footnote">revelation of the Qu'ran</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> Sawm has a number of important elements in its observance. It is a 
								primary way of <b>commemorating Ramadan</b> and honouring the occasion of the 
								<b>revelation of the Qu'ran</b>. Secondly it is a time where the hunger of 
								the person fasting brings to mind the <b>reality of poverty</b> and where 
								almsgiving is strongly encouraged.</div>
								<div class="footnote">self discipline in fasting</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In successfully completing the requirements of fasting, a Muslim learns <b>self 
								  discipline</b> and overcomes degrees of selfishness, greed and laziness. There is 
								  also a <b>strong spiritual element</b> to the fasting. Many Muslims make 
								  <b>extra effort in prayer</b> and religious learning during the month of Ramadan. 
								  Mosques hold special <b>additional times of prayer known as "tarawih".
								  </b>
								  <p>The month of Ramadan <b>ends with the feast of "Id-ul-Fitr"</b> 
							    which is one of the great celebratory occasions in Islam.</p></div>
							    <h2>Hajj</h2>
							    <div class="footnote">pilgrimage to Makkah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In successfully completing the requirements of fasting, a Muslim learns <b>self 
								  discipline</b> and overcomes degrees of selfishness, greed and laziness. There is 
								  also a <b>strong spiritual element</b> to the fasting. Many Muslims make 
								  <b>extra effort in prayer</b> and religious learning during the month of Ramadan.

								<div class="footnote">purpose of Hajj</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> The word "hajj" means to embark on a <b>journey with a purpose</b>. 
								The purpose is essentially to <b>visit the Ka'bah in Makkah</b> and 
								<b>worship on Mount Arafat</b>. The pilgrimage takes place during the twelfth 
								month of the Muslim calendar "Dhul-Hijjah".</div>
								<div class="footnote">challenge of organisation</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The <b>organisation of the hajj</b> is an enormous challenge both for the 
								individuals undertaking the pilgrimage and for those in Saudi Arabia responsible for 
								organising it. The individual not only needs to <b>provide for their own needs</b> 
								on the pilgrimage but they also need to provide for the <b>needs of their family while 
								they are away</b>.</div>
								<div class="footnote">hajj guides</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> For the organisers in Saudi Arabia the hajj is an enormous exercise in logistics. Over a 
								million people gather annually in Saudi Arabia for the hajj. Those undertaking the hajj 
								are <b>organised into groups</b> under the guidance of an <b>experienced hajj 
								guide</b> who is able to <b>ensure that the proper protocols are followed.</b></div>
								<div class="footnote">community and goodwill</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Despite the degree of organisation and the expertise of the hajj leaders, there is an 
								inevitable element of chaos with such a large gathering. Yet despite the heat, the logistical 
								difficulties and enormous crowd there is a <b>great sense of community and goodwill</b> 
								among the pilgrims which readily outweighs the difficulties encountered.</div>
								<div class="footnote">attitude of pilgrims</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> The hajj is an event for <b>Muslims only,</b> tourists are not allowed to 
								attend. It is expected that the pilgrims who attend will be people with the <b>maturity 
								and soundness of mind</b> to understand the significance of what they are undertaking. 
								<b>A</b><b>certain degree of physical fitness is expected</b> in order to 
								manage the physical demands of the pilgrimage.</div>
								<div class="footnote">intention known as "niyyah"</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Some Muslims are <b>not able to undertake the pilgrimage</b> themselves due to 
								<b>poor health, a lack of financial means or unexpected and unavoidable circumstances</b>. 
								In these cases Muslims believe that the <b>intention will suffice</b>. This intention, 
								known as <b>"niyyah"</b> is an important element. Muslims believe that 
								<b>Allah judges them on their intentions providing that their efforts are sincere</b>. 
								Therefore someone who is genuinely unable to perform the hajj need not feel that they are failing in 
								their religious duty.</div>
								<div class="footnote">symbolic pilgimage</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> In some instances, Muslims who are <b>not able to perform the hajj</b> seek to 
								<b>join the pilgrims in a symbolic way</b> by <b>paying for someone</b> 
								else to attend in their place or <b>giving to charity</b> the money that they have 
								saved for the hajj. In the case of paying for someone else to attend in their place there is 
								a restriction that this person must already have performed the hajj on their own behalf.</div>
								<div class="footnote">prescribed rituals</div>                                     
								<div class="text">There are various <b>prescribed aspects</b> undertaken by pilgrims performing 
								the hajj. The preparation phase of the hajj takes place <b>outside of Makkah</b>. 
								This preparatory stage involves placing themselves in an <b>appropriate disposition or 
								attitude</b>. This involves a deliberate and <b>conscious striving towards a state 
								of purity</b>. This attitude is known as <b>"ihram".</b> As a sign 
								of their preparedness all <b>normal clothing is replaced</b> by a simple ensemble 
								of two white cloths, one worn around the waist, the other draped over the left shoulder. 
								Women wear a plain garment covering all but their hands, their feet and their face.</div>
								<div class="footnote">arrival in Makkah</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> As the <b>pilgrim arrives in Makkah</b> they begin to repeatedly pray the 
								<b>prayer known as "talbiyah"</b> which is in the form of a response 
								to the call to perform the hajj. Immediately upon arriving in Makkah <b>pilgrims go to 
								the Ka'bah and encircle it seven times</b>. This encircling is known as 
								<b>"tawaf".</b></div>
								<div class="footnote">journey to Mina</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The next event to follow is the <b>procession known as the "sa'y".
								</b> This procession takes place between Safa and Marwah and is <b>completed seven 
								times</b>. This procession is based on the Qu'ranic tradition of Hajar's 
								search for water in the desert.</div>
								<div class="footnote">procession</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> The next part of the hajj involves a journey to Mina which is undertaken on the 8th day 
								of the month of Dhul-Hijjah. In Mina<b> pebbles are hurled a pillars</b> to 
								symbolise the <b>rejection of the devil</b> and all works of evil.</div>
								<div class="footnote">Mount Arafat</div>                                     
								<div class="text">After camping in Mina the journey continues to <b>Mount</b><b> 
								Arafat</b>. On the plain of Arafat people <b>stand from midday until sunset in a 
								state of meditation</b> This is known as the <b>"wuquf" or the 
								standing before Allah</b>. The pilgrims then climb Mount Arafat where a sermon is 
								preached.
                                <p> The pilgrimage continues, however, to Mina via Muzdalifah where <b>night prayer</b> 
								is held together with a <b>ritual stoning of the devil</b>. On the morning of 10 
								Dhul-Hijjah the pilgrims stand before dawn in a brief<b> repetition of the 
								"wuquf"</b> before moving on towards Mina as the sun begins to rise. </p></div>
								<div class="footnote">offering of sacrifice</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
In Mina the pilgrims camp for <b>three days</b> while offering the required <b>sacrifice of an animal for Id-ul-Adha</b>. After this men have their <b>heads shaved</b> and women are required to cut their hair by at least 2.5 cm.                                                                
							    <p>The hajj then <b>returns to Makkah</b> for another <b>encircling of the Ka'bah as the final event of the pilgrimage</b>. Having completed the hajj Muslims are entitled to take the name <b>Hajji or Hajjah</b>. </p>
