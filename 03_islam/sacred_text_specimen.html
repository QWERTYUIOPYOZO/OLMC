									<h1>Specimen Questions </h1>
									<p><strong>Assess the importance of both the Qur'an and the Hadith in Islam</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Examine how two principal beliefs of Islam are reflected in the Qur'an</strong></p>
										  <h2>Sample Responses</h2>
											<p><strong>Assess the importance of both the Qur'an and the Hadith in Islam</strong></p>
											<p>For the followers of Islam, the sacred text of the Qur'an and the traditions of the Hadith are both extremely important. They do, however, have different functions in Islam and they have different levels of importance. The Qur'an and the Hadith can be understood as complimentary texts, however, the Hadith remains subordinate to the Qur'an which is the fundamental text.
											<p>The Qur'an and to a lesser degree the Hadith are responsible for providing guidance for Muslims in all aspects of life. Accordingly it would be difficult to overestimate their importance, especially that of the Qur'an.
											<p>The Qur'an is the fundamental text for all Muslims. It is believed to contain the revelation of Allah, complete and unaltered as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad beginning with the first revelation on the night of power and continuing over hundreds of occasions during the remainder of his life.
											<p>The Qur'an is organised into 114 surahs or chapters. The order of the Qur'an today is not the same order in which the revelations were received. The order is according to an instruction given to the Prophet Muhammad later in his life. 
											<p>Muhammad was not a literate person and accordingly he had to commit the Qur'an to memory rather than have it written down. Muslims believe that to hear the Qur'an read aloud is a blessing and so are encouraged to read it aloud.  The reading aloud of the Qur'an is considered to be a source of blessing for both the reader and the hearer. This belief provides a good sense of the degree of respect and reverence held for the Qur'an. 
											<p>Other examples of this degree of respect can be seen in the protocols for reading of the Qur'an and its care. The Qur'an is prominent in every aspect of Muslim life and its authority is supreme and unquestioned. It is regarded as a Holy book and treated with the greatest respect. The Qur'an is not to be placed on the ground and should not be touched unnecessarily. When being read it is often placed on a low stool known as a "kursi".
											<p>When the Qur'an is read people must remain silent. There is to be no food or drink consumed during the reading of the Qur'an and all noise should be avoided. Before reading from the Qur'an a person must bathe or wash carefully and ensure that they are properly disposed with the appropriate attitude to hear the word of Allah.  Women are not permitted to read from the Qur'an during the course of their monthly period.
											<p>When not being used the Qur'an is placed in an elevated position to avoid the possibility of something being placed on top of it and it is also covered to prevent dust from gathering on it. The importance of the Qur'an as the sacred book of Islam is clearly evident in these protocols.
											<p>Another indication of its importance is the custom of memorising the entire Qur'an. A person who knows the entire Qur'an off by heart is known as a hafiz. Such a person is greatly honoured in the Muslim community.
											<p>During the life of the Prophet Muhammad, many of his companions committed the entire Qur'an to memory. It was the death of a large number of huffaz in a battle after the death of Muhammad that prompted Abu Bakr to commission the first written version of the Qur'an. 
											<p>In preparing the written version of the Qur'an, not the slightest change was made. Nothing was removed, nothing was added, the order was preserved precisely. every word was regarded as the word of Allah and duly recorded in the text.
											<p>A further way of showing respect for the sacredness of the Qur'an can be seen in the process of its copying. Many editions of the Qur'an that have been produced are written in beautiful calligraphy. It is considered an honour to copy the Qur'an and the copyist would do this as beautifully as possible.
											<p>The message of the Qur'an is very clear and unmistakable. It announces the Day of Judgment and accompanying happiness for the faithful while the evil ones will experience the harshness of the eternal separation from Allah. Among those who are condemned were any who did not embrace the key principle of the one true God. The Qur'an includes statements which emphasise the importance of social justice and a code for moral living. 
											<p>Because the message of the Qur'an is so clear and direct it has an immediate impact on the lives of Muslims. The primary focus of Islam is submission to Allah and the teachings of the Qur'an provide the necessary guidance and instructions for this to take place.
											<p>The second element of the guidance to Muslims comes through considering the lessons to be learned from the words and actions of the Prophet Muhammad.  The Hadiths are the main source of this guidance.
											<p>The term "hadith" means that which has been recounted or told. The hadith refers to the collection of traditions of the words and deeds of Muhammad. Many such traditions emerged after the death of Muhammad and these are highly respected though they are viewed separately and subordinate to the Qur'an.
											<p>There are two types of hadiths. Those known as Prophetic Hadiths and those known as Sacred Hadiths. The Sacred Hadiths or Hadith Qudsi are regarded as the most important. They are believed by many Muslims to not only reveal the tradition of the Prophet Muhammad but to also convey something about the nature of Allah. 
											<p>Hadith Qudsi are regarded as words from Allah which were communicated to Muhammad, however, unlike the Qur'an, these messages were passed on in the words of the Prophet rather than exactly as they were received from Allah.
											<p>The sayings of Muhammad show him to be a man of great wisdom and character, compassion and mercy. He is loved and respected because of his faith in Allah and his great concern for others.
											<p>It is very easy for a hadith to be altered in the process of transmission and scholars check very carefully to gauge the reliability of the hadith in question. A cautious approach was always taken in checking the hadith to avoid inadvertently falsifying the Prophets words.
											<p>The process of authentication of a hadith involved tracing its emergence back to someone who had actually been with the Prophet. The line of transmission is known as a chain. So checking the authenticity of a hadith meant checking the chain of transmission and confirming the validity of its origins and the integrity of its transmission.
											<p>The hadiths have proved invaluable to Muslim communities in addressing an issue which is not explicitly covered by the Qur'an. In these cases, the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad can prove to be a very useful substitute. 
											<p>However, Muslims do not regard the hadith as sacred as they do the Qur'an. Clearly there is a considerable difference in value between the words of a human being, no matter how sublime, and the complete and unaltered word of Allah as found in the Qur'an.
											<p>It is evident, therefore that the Qur'an and the Hadith play an extremely significant role in providing guidance for all aspects of Muslim life. The Qur'an, in particular as the normative text of Islam, has far reaching effect. The Hadith, as it has been shown is also an important text, complimentary to the Qur'an and always subordinate to it. Nevertheless it also has great significance for Muslims.
