									<h1>Content Description</h1>
						<h2>The social conditions and religious practices that existed in pre-Islamic Arabia</h2>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Beginnings of Islam</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								The religion of Islam <b>began during the seventh century CE</b> on the 
								Arabian peninsular in the territory which is the modern day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The 
								Arabian peninsular is an extremely arid desert region with very little fertile soil. Other 
								than in the immediate vicinity of scattered oases there is very little vegetation to speak 
								of. Essentially it is a region dominated by sandy dunes.
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Shepherds and merchants</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The local tribes people led <b>semi nomadic lives</b> and were 
								predominantly engaged as shepherds or in servicing the well established <b>trade routes</b> 
								between the Indian sub-continent to the East and Northern powers of Syria and Egypt. The 
								shepherd tribes were small and scattered, moving livestock between the desert oases where 
								they could find feed for their animals. The Arabian cities were established along the trade 
								routes and in addition to the service of the trade they were able to provide a livelihood 
								for various trades and crafts associated with urban life.</p> 
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Makkah and Madinah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The two major cities associated with the origins of Islam are the cities of <b>Makkah (Mecca) and Madinah (Medina)</b>. Makkah is about 80 kilometres from the Red Sea and lies in between the Mediterranean city of Gaza to the north and the city of Aden on the Indian Ocean to the south. Madinah is more than 300 kilometres further to the north. Makkah was a city founded on the trade routes between the Indian Ocean coastal towns and the great cities of Syria and Egypt
                                  <p>The religious affiliation of the Arab people was quite mixed. Predominantly they adhered to the <b>local nature religions</b> as well as those introduced along the trade routes from the Southern town of Aden to the Northern centres of Syria and Egypt. 
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Polytheism Judaism Christianity</div>                                     
								<div class="text">There were also devotees of the monotheistic religions of <b>Judaism and Christianity</b> in the region, however, these were minority groups in most areas though quite well established nonetheless.
								<p>The local religions were mostly polytheistic and often associated with an element of nature. Frequently they had a well developed <b>cultic practice</b> with temples, priests, sacrificial rituals etc. Associated with these established religious practices there was often a <b>thriving industry</b> in the manufacture and <b>sale of idols</b> and other images used in the ritual practices of the religion.
								</div> 
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Sacred City of Makkah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Makkah had significant status in religious terms due to the presence of the <b>Ka'bah</b> which had become a significant centre for religious devotion. Indeed, <b>Makkah could be regarded as a sacred city</b>. At the time of Muhammed there were believed to be over <b>350 altars or shrines to local deities</b>. The cult of the god "Ilah" and his offspring the goddesses "Al-lat", "Al-Uzza", and "Manat" was the most prominent in Makkah. 
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Worship at the Ka'bah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In and around Makkah, the most powerful tribe were the merchants known as the "Quaraish". Due to their wealth and power in the region, the <b>Quaraish</b> were able to control much of the economy in Makkah. They were able to regulate the activities of traders who came to Makkah and had control of the Ka'bah which enabled them to make enormous profits from the religious pilgrims coming to the shrines. These profits were reaped from maintaining a monopoly on the provisions required by those who had come to <b>worship at the Ka'bah</b>.
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">hanifs</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Among other tribes in the region, the influence and control of the Quaraish was often unpopular and in particular their <b>exploitation of religious pilgrims</b> was the source of some resentment. Among the opponents of the Quaraish were groups of <b>devout Arabs known as "hanifs"</b>. They sought to find purity of heart through long periods of reclusive reflection and meditation in the many desert caves surrounding Makkah. 
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2"> 
								<div class="footnote">Creator God</div>                                     
								<div class="text">
								The hanifs had an abiding belief that among the many gods there was <b>one of supreme power and authority</b>, a creator god which existed separately from the rest of creation and had been revealed in the past through messengers such as Musa and Isa. It was from among the hanifs that the Prophet Muhammad was born in 570 CE.
