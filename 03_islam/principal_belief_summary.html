		<h1>Summary Points </h1>
		<h3>The implications of Tawhid for Muslim belief</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>Aqida is an Arabic word meaning creed</li>
		  <li>It refers to the five basic articles of belief in the Qur'an </li>
		  <li>The five articles are belief in Allah, belief in the prophets, belief in angels, belief in the scripture and belief in the day of judgment. </li>
		  <li>Tawhid refers to the belief about Allah </li>
		  <li>It affirms that there is one true God </li>
		  <li>Nothing can rival Allah, nor can there exist anything that is even remotely like Allah. </li>
		  <li>Existing separately from creation in a transcendent way </li>
		  <li>Allah is all knowing and all powerful. Allah is also eternal. </li>
		  <li>The ways of Allah are beyond human understanding. </li>
		  <li>Allah is also understood as being close to the heart of every person </li>
		  <li>The concept of Tawhid it is incompatible with pride or arrogance </li>
		  <li>All individual gifts and talents are attributed to the gift of Allah </li>
		  <li>Possessions are in essence on loan from Allah regarded as transitory </li>
		  <li>Tawhid affirms that all things happen for a purpose </li>
		  <li>Whatever the circumstances this is what Allah has allowed </li>
		  <li>Acceptance of this leads trusting in the great love and compassion of Allah </li>
		  <li>Allah knows all things </li>
		  <li>Therefore to act with impure motives which in effect seek to deceive others and deceive Allah </li>
		  <li>Tawhid is also contravened by a false sense of personal holiness
		  <li>Allah is not fooled by appearances.
          <li>Any belief that diminishes this faith in the oneness and absoluteness of Allah is referred to as shirk. </li>
		  <li>Tawhid leads to a greater surrender to the will of Allah, </li>
		  <li>It reminds Muslims that they are accountable for their actions and for their use of worldly possessions</li>
		</ul>
        <h3>The role of the Books of Allah and prophecy in Islam</h3>
        <ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Prophecy is regarded as an essential element of Muslim belief</li>
          <li>It is the was in which the ways of Allah become revealed to human kind </li>
          <li>Muhammad is regarded as the last and the greatest of these messengers </li>
          <li>He is referred to as the seal of the prophets. </li>
          <li>The Qur'an refers to twenty four messengers among many others</li>
          <li>Adam is considered to be the first of these messengers and Muhammad the last. </li>
          <li>The term nabi is used to refer to an inspired prophet who has not been commissioned for a particular purpose and rusul is used to describe a messenger who has been given a particular mission </li>
          <li>The term rusul is given to famous biblical figures </li>
          <li>The Qur'an gives special attention to the figures who were responsible for the handing down of significant books </li>
          <li>The scrolls given to Ibrahim are known as "Sahifa", the books revealed to Musa are known as "Tawrah", those revealed to 							Dawud are known as "Zabur" and the teachings given to Isa are known as "Injil". </li>
          <li>The revealed books of the rusul are known as the Books of Allah </li>
          <li>Muslims believe that initially each of these revealed books contained the complete revelation of Allah, however, over time were not properly preserved and some such as the Sahifa given to Ibrahim have been completely lost. </li>
          <li>These books of Allah have been changed </li>
          <li>They no longer faithfully represent the message of Allah </li>
          <li>Thus the scriptures of the Jewish and Christian religions are profoundly respected by Muslims </li>
          <li>They cannot be relied upon because they have not been properly preserved</li>
          <li>The Qur'an is regarded as the last of the revealed books </li>
          <li> The Qur'an stands apart as the reliable and complete source of the revelation of Allah.</li>
