									<h1>Content Description</h1>
									<h2>The implications of Tahwid for Muslim belief </h2>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Articles of  faith for  Islam</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The term <strong>"Aqida"</strong> is an Arabic word <strong>meaning creed</strong>. However, there is no <strong>single formulation</strong> that has been agreed upon by all Muslims.
								<p>Despite the absence of any single authoritative creed there are, nevertheless <strong>five basic articles of belief</strong> which are clearly set out in the Qur'an. These beliefs are known as the Aqida. These are belief in <strong>Allah</strong>, belief in the <strong>prophets</strong>, belief in <strong>angels</strong>, belief in the <strong>scripture</strong> and belief in the <strong>day of judgment</strong>.</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote"> Tawhid</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The first of the beliefs of the Aqida is known as <strong>Tawhid</strong> which refers to the <strong>belief about Allah</strong>. Muslims believe that Allah is immanent and transcendent, close to each individual yet outside of creation itself.</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Oneness and absoluteness of Allah</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The term Tawhid means "<strong>the alone</strong>" which refers to the <strong>oneness</strong> and <strong>absoluteness</strong> of Allah. Muslims believe that by accepting that there is <strong>one true God</strong> they are also making statements about the absolute power and authority of this one God. Nothing can rival Allah, nor can there exist anything that is even remotely like Allah.
								"He is Allah, the One, Allah is Eternal and Absolute. None is born of Him, He is unborn. There is none like unto Him" (surah 112).</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Outside of creation</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The Muslim belief in the greatness of Allah means that Allah is understood as existing separately from creation in a <strong>transcendent</strong> way. Allah <strong>created all things</strong> but is outside of this creation. Allah is all knowing and all powerful. Allah is also eternal.								</p>
								  <p>These attributes of Allah mean that the exact nature of Allah will always be beyond human understanding. </p>
								  <p>"no vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision; He is above all comprehension yet is acquainted with all things" (surah 6:103).</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Immanence</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Despite the awesome character of Allah, Allah is also understood as being <strong>close to the heart</strong> of every person and knows even their innermost thoughts.
								<p> </p>The notion of Tawhid has a number of important implications for Muslims.</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Pride and arrogance</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Firstly, it is <strong>incompatible with pride or arrogance</strong>. Tawhid acknowledges that every talent, skill, ability or attribute of a human being is directly attributed to the gift of Allah in creating that person. To claim any of this as one's own is to deny that these talents are gifts of Allah.</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Possessions</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Secondly, Tawhid does not allow a person to regard possessions as their own. They are in essence <strong>on loan</strong> from Allah and are to be regarded as <strong>transitory</strong>.</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Purpose</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Thirdly, Tawhid acknowledges that <strong>all things happen for a purpose</strong> and that it is not appropriate for a person to complain about or seek to change their situation in life. This is what <strong>Allah has allowed</strong> and though they may not understand the reason for this circumstance a person is meant to accept it, <strong>trusting in the great love and compassion of Allah</strong>.</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
 								<div class="footnote">Motives</div>
   								<div class="text">Fourthly, a lack of integrity in actions is tantamount to believing that Allah can be fooled. Allah knows all things, even the motives of every individual person and each particular action. Therefore it goes against Tawhid to act with <strong>impure motives</strong> which in effect seek to deceive others and deceive Allah.</p>
								</div>
							  </div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Personal holiness</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Fifthly, a <strong>false sense of personal holiness</strong> is an example of hypocrisy which offends Allah and is therefore not compatible with Tawhid. Allah knows the weaknesses and lack of faith of all people and is <strong>not fooled by appearances</strong>.</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Ignorance</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Finally, <strong>Tawhid is incompatible with ignorance of Allah's will</strong>. A person is required to know of Allah and know the ways of Allah.</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">Shirk</div>                                     
								<div class="text">When a person denies the basis of Tawhid in any way this is known as "<strong>shirk</strong>". The concept of shirk is particularly applied to any idea which <strong>does not accept the essential character of Allah</strong>. Any belief that diminishes this faith in the oneness and absoluteness of Allah is referred to as shirk.</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								  <div class="footnote">
								  <p>Surrender</p>
								</div>                                     
								<div class="text">For Muslims, the belief in <strong>Tawhid</strong> provides a number of important dimensions to their lives. Tawhid leads to a <strong>greater surrender</strong> to the will of Allah, the ultimate goal of Islam. It gives Muslims confidence and assurance and means that they do not need to rely on or submit to other authorities. 
								<p></p>Tawhid means that Muslims know that they are <strong>accountable for their actions</strong> and for their <strong>use of worldly possessions</strong>. With this is mind Tawhid leads to a great <strong>sense of responsibility</strong> among Muslims. It also means that they hold a <strong>sense of trust in Allah</strong> which allows them to accept difficult circumstances without losing hope. <br>
								<p></p>Finally it provides them with a sense of purpose and determination. They are <strong>dedicated to the will of Allah</strong>. It is a challenging but ultimately rewarding vocation.</p>
