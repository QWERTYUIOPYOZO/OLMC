								   <h2>The role of the Books of Allah and prophecy in Islam</h2>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">
								  <p>Role of Prophecy </p>
								</div>                                     
								<div class="text"><strong>Prophecy</strong> is regarded as an <strong>essential element</strong> of Muslim belief. It is the way in which Allah makes known to human beings that which is required of them. In other words, prophecy is the vehicle through which the ways of Allah become <strong>revealed to human kind</strong>.</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">
								  <p>Historical tradition of Prophecy</p>
								</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Muslims do not believe that <strong>Muhammad</strong> was the first to receive a revelation of the word of Allah. Rather he was the last in a long line of messengers. He is regarded as the <strong>last and the greatest </strong>of these messengers and is referred to as the <strong>seal of the prophets</strong>.
								<p></p>Likewise Muhammad is not strictly regarded as the founder of Islam. According to Muslim belief the founder of Islam is Allah and <strong>Allah was revealed to many people before Muhammad</strong>. Those who believed in Allah and submitted to the will of Allah are regarded as true Muslims even though they existed long before Muhammad.								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">
								  <p>Messengers of Allan</p>
								</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The Qur'an refers to <strong>twenty four messengers</strong> who among literally thousands of others have been called by Allah and given the revelation of the message. Adam is considered to be the first of these messengers and <strong>Muhammad the last</strong>.</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">
								  <p>Nabi and Rusul</p>
								</div>                                     
								<div class="text">In the Qur'an two Arabic terms are used to talk about prophets or messengers of Allah. The two terms are "nabi" and "rusul". The term <strong>nabi</strong> is used to refer to an <strong>inspired prophet</strong> who has not been commissioned for a particular purpose and <strong>rusul</strong> is used to describe a <strong>messenger</strong> who has been given a particular mission. </div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">
								  <p> Biblical prophets</p>
								</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> The term rusul is given to famous biblical figures as well as to the Prophet Muhammad. The biblical figures include Adam, Nua, Ibrahim, Musa, Dawud and Isa.</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">
								  <p>Books of Allah</p>
								</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Among these the Qur'an gives <strong>special attention</strong> to the figures who were responsible for the <strong>handing down of significant books</strong>. The scrolls given to <strong>Ibrahim</strong> are known as "<strong>Sahifa</strong>", the books revealed to <strong>Musa</strong> are known as "<strong>Tawrah</strong>", those revealed to <strong>Dawud</strong> are known as "<strong>Zabur</strong>" and the teachings given to <strong>Isa</strong> are known as "<strong>Injil</strong>".</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">
								  <p>Books lost or altered</p>
								</div>                                     
								<div class="text">Collectively the revealed books of the rusul are known as the <strong>Books of Allah</strong>. Muslims believe that initially each of these revealed books contained the <strong>complete revelation of Allah</strong>, however, over time were <strong>not properly preserved</strong> and some such as the Sahifa given to Ibrahim have been completely lost.
								<p>It is believed that these <strong>books of Allah</strong> have been <strong>changed</strong> and that they <strong>no longer faithfully represent the message of Allah</strong>. Thus Muslims do not view the Torah of the Jewish religion of the Gospels of the Christian religion to be the authentic Tawrah and Injil given to Musa and Isa</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">
								  <p>Jewish and Christian scriptures respected</p>
								</div>                                     
								<div class="text"> Thus the <strong>scriptures </strong> of the Jewish and Christian religions are <strong>profoundly respected </strong> by Muslims because they originate with the authentic books of Allah, however, given that they have been altered from their original form, they <strong>cannot be relied upon </strong> </div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">
								  <p>Qur'an has universal significance</p>
								</div>                                     
								<div class="text">These books of Allah are also understood to have been a message given to a particular group of people in contrast to the Qur'an which has universal significance.</div>
								</div>
								<div class="content2">
								<div class="footnote">
								  <p>Qur'an last of revealed books</p>
								</div>                                     
								<div class="text">The <strong>Qur'an</strong> is regarded as the <strong>last of the revealed books</strong>. It gives complete guidance and has universal significance. Because it was given directly to the Prophet Muhammad, committed to memory by him and his supporters and then finally written down exactly as it was received, the Qur'an stands apart as <strong>the reliable and complete source of the revelation of Allah</strong>.</p>
								  <p> Among all the books of Allah it is the only source which is complete and unaltered. Therefore it is fundamentally reliable and trustworthy.</p>
