	    <h1>Summary Points</h1>
		<h3>The Qur'an</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>The Qur'an is the fundamental text for all Muslims.
		  <li>It is believed to contain the revelation of Allah, complete and unaltered 
		  <li>The Qur'an is organised into 114 surahs or chapters
		  <li>The order of the Qur'an today is not the same order in which the revelations were received. 
		  <li>The order is according to an instruction given to the Prophet Muhammad 
		  <li>Each surah has a name which is linked to a feature or a word contained in it. 
		  <li>Muhammad was not a literate person. 
		  <li>Qur'an had to be memorised.
		  <li>A person who knows the entire Qur'an off by heart is known as a hafiz
		  <li>Abu Bakr began the process of having a written version of the Qur'an developed 
		  <li>He commissioned Zaid ibn Thabit to make the first written version of the Qur'an.
		  <li>Zaid ensured that not the slightest change was made. 
		  <li>Many editions of the Qur'an that have been produced are written in beautiful calligraphy. It is considered an honour to copy the Qur'an and the copyist would do this as beautifully as possible.
		  <li>The Qur'an is prominent in every aspect of Muslim life  
		  <li>Its authority is supreme and unquestioned. 
		  <li>It is regarded as a Holy book and treated with the greatest respect. 
		  <li>The Qur'an is not to be placed on the ground and should not be touched unnecessarily. When begin read it is often placed on a low stool known as a "kursi".
		  <li>When the Qur'an is read people must remain silent. 
		  <li>There is to be no food or drink consumed during the reading of the Qur'an 
		  <li>All noise should be avoided. 
		  <li>Before reading from the Qur'an a person must bathe or wash carefully and ensure that they are properly disposed with the appropriate attitude to hear the word of Allah.  Women are not permitted to read from the Qur'an during the course of their monthly period.
		  <li>When not being used the Qur'an is placed in an elevated position to avoid the possibility of something being placed on top of it
		  <li>It is also covered to prevent dust from gathering on it.
		  <li>The message of the Qur'an is very clear and unmistakable. 
		  <li>It announces the Day of Judgment and accompanying happiness for the faithful while the evil ones will experience the harshness of the eternal separation from Allah. 
		  <li>The Qur'an speaks respectfully of the biblical prophets such as Ibrahim, Musa and Isa The Prophet Muhammed is the last and the greatest of the Prophets following in the tradition of the biblical prophets such as Musa and Isa.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>The Hadith</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>The term "hadith" means that which has been recounted or told. 
		  <li>The hadith refers to the collection of traditions of the words and deeds of Muhammad. 
		  <li>There are two types of hadiths.
		  <li>Those known as Prophetic Hadiths and those known as Sacred Hadiths.
		  <li>The Sacred Hadiths or Hadith Qudsi are regarded as the most important. 
		  <li>Hadith Qudsi are regarded as words from Allah which were communicated to Muhammad, however, these messages were passed on in the words of Muhammad.
		  <li>The traditions came to be gathered together in collections which came to be the basis for the hadiths. 
		  <li>Two scholars from the early period of Islam are most noted for their work in the collection of hadiths. 
		  <li>Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Bukhari is reputed to have collected 2762 hadiths while Abul Husayn Muslim ibn al- Hajjaj had a collection of 4000.
		  <li>Inevitably there was an enormous proliferation of reputed hadiths. 
		  <li>It is estimated that within three centuries of Muhammad's death that over 600,000 hadiths were known. 
		  <li>Many were false or dubious hadiths 
		  <li>The process of authentication of a hadith involved tracing its emergence back to someone who had actually been with the Prophet. 
		  <li>The line of transmission is known as a chain. 
	      <li>A cautious approach was always taken in checking the hadith to avoid inadvertently falsifying the Prophets words.
		  <li>The hadiths have proved invaluable to Muslim communities in addressing an issue which is not explicitly covered by the Qur'an. 
		  <li>However, Muslims do not regard the hadith as sacred as they do the Qur'an.</li>
