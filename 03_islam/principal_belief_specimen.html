									<h1>Specimen Questions </h1>
									<p><strong>Explain the significance of Tawhid for Muslims. </strong></p> 
											<p><strong>Evaluate the use of the Aqida as a creed for the Muslim tradition. </strong></p>
											<h2>Sample Responses</h2>
											<p><strong>Explain the significance of Tawhid for Muslims. </strong></p>
											<p>In Islam, the notion of Tawhid relates to core beliefs about Allah and as such Tawhid plays a central role in the religious understanding and practice of Muslims. Tawhid is essentially the Islamic belief in the oneness and absoluteness of Allah. It is, therefore, a foundation for all the beliefs of Islam. Tawhid is the primary belief among the five basic articles of faith known as the aqida. It is an affirmation of the nature of Allah and a confirmation that in all of creation there is absolutely no other than is like Allah. </p>
											<p>Tawhid has enormous significance in the faith and practice of Muslims as it affirms for them the nature of Allah, all knowing and all powerful. It also affirms the immanence and transcendence of Allah. These beliefs are important for the integrity of life for Muslims. Tawhid assures Muslims that their entire lives and consciousness is caught up In the will of Allah. </p>
											<p>While there is no single formulation of faith such as a creed of Islam, the Qur'an clearly expresses a number of core beliefs. There are five basic articles of belief expressed in the Qur'an. These five articles are known as the "aqida" which means creed in Arabic. The five articles express the belief in Allah, the belief in the prophets, belief in angels, belief in the scripture and belief in the Day of judgment. </p>
											<p>The first of these beliefs is the belief in Allah and is known as Tawhid. Tawhid first of all affirms the existence of Allah. If affirms that Allah is the one true God and that absolutely nothing can rival Allah. There is nothing that exists or that can exist that is even remotely like Allah. </p>
											<p>Tawhid affirms that Allah exists in a transcendent way which is separate from or outside of creation. Allah is not contained within creation or dependent on creation in any way. As an eternal being Allah alone existed before creation and brought all of creation into being. </p>
											<p>The Muslim belief in the greatness of Allah means that Allah is understood as existing separately from creation in a transcendent way. Allah created all things but is outside of this creation. Allah is all knowing and all powerful. </p>
											<p>These attributes of Allah mean that the exact nature of Allah will always be beyond human understanding. "no vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision; He is above all comprehension yet is acquainted with all things" (surah 6:103). </p>
											<p>Despite the awesome character of Allah, Allah is also understood as being close to the heart of every person and knows even their innermost thoughts. This is the belief in the immanence of Allah. Allah is everywhere in creation and intimately involved with the creation at all levels. </p>
											<p>For human beings, this immanence amounts to Allah having complete knowledge of them, their thoughts and their motives. </p>
											<p>The notion of Tawhid has a number of important implications for Muslims. </p>
											<p>Firstly, it is incompatible with pride or arrogance. Tawhid acknowledges that every talent, skill, ability or attribute of a human being is directly attributed to the gift of Allah in creating that person. To claim any of this as one's own is to deny that these talents are gifts of Allah. </p>
											<p>Secondly, Tawhid does not allow a person to regard possessions as their own. They are in essence on loan from Allah and are to be regarded as transitory. </p>
											<p>Tawhid also affirms that all things happen for a purpose and that it is not appropriate for a person to complain about or seek to change their situation in life. This is what Allah has allowed and though they may not understand the reason for this circumstance a person is meant to accept it, trusting in the great love and compassion of Allah. </p>
											<p>Fourthly, a lack of integrity in actions is tantamount to believing that Allah can be fooled. Allah knows all things, even the motives of every individual person and each particular action. Therefore it goes against Tawhid to act with impure motives which in effect seek to deceive others and deceive Allah. </p>
											<p>Fifthly, a false sense of personal holiness is an example of hypocrisy which offends Allah and is therefore not compatible with Tawhid. Allah knows the weaknesses and lack of faith of all people and is not fooled by appearances.</p>
								<p>Finally, Tawhid is incompatible with ignorance of Allah's will. A person is required to know of Allah and know the ways of Allah. </p>
                                            <p>When a person denies the basis of Tawhid in any way this is known as "shirk". The concept of shirk is particularly applied to any idea which does not accept the essential character of Allah. Any belief that diminishes this faith in the oneness and absoluteness of Allah is referred to as shirk. </p>
                                            <p>For Muslims, the belief in Tawhid provides a number of important dimensions to their lives. Tawhid leads to a greater surrender to the will of Allah, the ultimate goal of Islam. It gives Muslims confidence and assurance and means that they do not need to rely on or submit to other authorities. </p>
                                            <p>Tawhid means that Muslims know that they are accountable for their actions and for their use of worldly possessions. With this is mind Tawhid leads to a great sense of responsibility among Muslims. It also means that that hold a sense of trust in Allah which allows them to accept difficult circumstances without losing hope. </p>
                                            <p>Finally it provides them with a sense of purpose and determination. They are dedicated to the will of Allah. It is a challenging but ultimately rewarding vocation.</p>
                                            <p>Clearly the idea of Tawhid is a fundamental one for Muslims. It expresses their most significant beliefs in the oneness and uniqueness of Allah. It also provides a core belief which underpins all other belief of Islam. In this sense Tawhid is understood as the primary expression of the faith of Islam. </p>
