	    <p> The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam (arkan-al-Islam). It is,
	      therefore, one of the most important requirements of the Muslim faith.
	      The Hajj is the annual pilgrimage to the holy city Makkah. All adult male

	      if they are able. Many Muslim women also undertake the Hajj.</p>
	    <p> The Hajj takes place each year in the month of Dhul-Hijjah and involves
	      pilgrims traveling to Makkah in Saudi Arabia where they carry out a number
	      of important rituals such as the circling of the Kab'ah, the stand
	      before Allah (wuquf) on the plain of Arafat, the stoning of the pillars
	      at Mina and the sacrifice on the festival of Id-ul-Adha. Other rituals
	      include the shaving of hair and drinking or collecting water from the
	      well of Zamzam.</p>
	    <p> Muslims travel from all over the world to undertake the Hajj with over
	      two million pilgrims taking part each year.</p>

          <li><strong>Funeral ceremony </strong></li>
          <li><strong>Hajj</strong></li>
        </ul>
	    <p> The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam (arkan-al-Islam). It is,
	      therefore, one of the most important requirements of the Muslim faith.
	      The Hajj is the annual pilgrimage to the holy city Makkah. All adult male
	      Muslims are required to undertake the Hajj at least once in their lifetime
        if they are able. Many Muslim women also undertake the Hajj.</p>
	    <p> As one of the five pillars, Muslims are required to undertake the Hajj
	      in obedience to the Qur'an. It is an example of how a Muslim will
	      submit their lives to the will of Allah. The commitment and dedication
	      required to undertake the Hajj are understood as important disciplines
	      in the goal of perfect submission to Allah.</p>
	    <p> Not only does the pilgrim have to meet certain practical requirements
	      such as providing for their own needs and the needs of their family while
	      they are away but the pilgrim must also undertake appropriate preparation
	      to ensure they are come with the right disposition. In Islam, the intention
	      that accompanies the action is of critical importance and if would be
	      futile for a Muslim to undertake the Hajj without an appropriate inner
	      or spiritual attitude.</p>
	    <p> Many of the rituals of the Hajj are related to the aims of rejecting
	      the temptations of the devil and submitting to the will of Allah. Therefore,
	      for the Muslim undertaking the Hajj, there is a strong sense of determination
	      to fulfill the requirements of the Hajj as a sign of their rejection of
	      the temptations of the devil.</p>
	    <p> The stand before Allah (wuquf) provides the pilgrim with an occasion
	      of forgiveness of all past sins and an opportunity to begin life anew.
	      Having received the forgiveness of Allah, the Muslim experiences a great
	      sense of peace and wellbeing.</p>
	    <p> Muslims undertaking the Hajj also experience a profound sense of community
	      with millions of Muslims from all parts of the earth coming together for
	      the single purpose of submission to Allah. While there is a great diversity
	      of race and nation, there is a powerful unity of purpose which creates
	      a profound sense of community.</p>
	    <p>(approx 350 words)</p>
	    <p><b>(c) Analyse how ONE significant practice within Islam expresses
        the beliefs of Islam (6)</b></p>
	    <p> The Hajj is a significant practice within Islam which is based on and
	      consequently expresses a number of important beliefs. The essence of
	      Islam is surrender to Allah and this surrender is epitomised in and
	      through the Hajj. The rituals associated with the Hajj are based on
	      a number of important encounters between Allah and human kind in ancient
	      times. Accordingly in carrying out the rituals of the Hajj, a pilgrim
        is engaging with some of the important beliefs of Islam.</p>
	    <p> The central moment of the Hajj is the stand before Allah or "wuquf" which
	      takes place on the at the Mount of Mercy on the plain of Arafat. The stand
	      is designed to replicate for the pilgrim the time when Adam and Eve stood
	      before Allah seeking restoration and forgiveness of their sins. The forgiveness
	      granted to Adam and Eve provides assurance to the Muslim that Allah will
	      also forgive their sins and allow them to begin with a fresh start to
	      their life of submission.</p>
	    <p> Another important ritual of the Hajj is the festival of sacrifice "Id-ul-Adha".
	      This festival recalls the events surrounding Ibrahim being called by Allah
	      to sacrifice his son Isma'il. Ibrahim was obedient to the call of
	      Allah even though he was strongly tempted by the devil to disobey the
	      command. The fact that Ibrahim resisted the temptation and remained faithful
	      to Allah's call is commemorated in the sacrifice of Id-ul-Adha.</p>
	    <p> The stoning of the pillars at Mina is another ritual drawn from the
	      same tradition. In his rejection of the devil the tradition tells that
	      Ibrahim threw stones at the devil. In expressing their rejection of the
	      devil, pilgrims on the Hajj throw stones at pillars at Mina which symbolise
	      the devil.</p>
	    <p> Another ritual involves pilgrims walking between Safa and Marwah to
	      commemorate Hajar's search for water in the desert. This ritual
	      focuses on the search for the things of lasting value and on the belief
	      that Allah will provide all that is needed.</p>
	    <p> The circling of the Ka'bah is another ritual of the Hajj which
	      once again expresses the idea of obedience and submission to the will
	      of Allah. The circling of the Ka'bah expresses obedience in responding
	      to the call to undertake the Hajj and symbolises a Muslim's submission
	      to Allah which is the essence of Islam.</p>
	    <p>(approx 350 words)</p>
	    <p><b>Question 4 - Islam </b><b> (20 marks)</b></p>
	    <p><b> Outline the purpose and assess the significance of ONE of the
	        following practices in Islam: </b></p>
	    <ul>
          <li><strong>Friday prayer at the Mosque </strong></li>
          <li><strong>Funeral ceremony </strong></li>
          <li><strong>Hajj</strong></li>
        </ul>
	    <p> The Hajj or pilgrimage to Makkah is one of the five pillars of Islam "arkan-al-Islam" which
	      all Muslim males are requires to carry out. Its purpose is essentially
	      to facilitate the act of submission to Allah which is at the heart of
	      Islam. It has enormous significance, not only for the pilgrim undertaking
        the Hajj but also for the wider Muslim community.</p>
	    <p> Examining the purpose of the Hajj in more detail will allow a greater
	      appreciation of its significance. The purpose can be examined through
	      considering the rituals undertaken during the Hajj and their meaning in
	      terms of the faith of Islam. Such rituals include the stand before Allah "wuquf",
	      the stoning of the pillars at Mina, the commemoration of the festival
	      of sacrifice "Id-ul-Adha", the circling of the Ka'bah
	      and drawing water from the well of Zamzam.</p>
	    <p> Each of these rituals have profound meaning and are closely related
	      to important elements of the faith of Muslims. Therefore, in undertaking
	      the Hajj and completing these rituals, the pilgrim is engaging with the
	      most important elements of the tradition and moving towards a more perfect
	      submission to Allah which is the ultimate goal of Islam.</p>
	    <p> The central ritual of the Hajj is the stand before Allah "wuquf",
	      sometimes referred to simply as the stand. Its commemoration of the restoration
	      of Adam and Eve and the forgiveness of their sin of disobedience is of
	      profound significance to the Muslim pilgrim. The forgiveness and restoration
	      experienced by Adam and Eve in ancient times give an assurance that Allah
	      is willing to forgive people today.</p>
	    <p> The stand before Allah gives the pilgrim the opportunity of experiencing
	      the love and forgiveness of Allah and allows them to be free from any
	      past sin, beginning life anew and enjoying a great sense of peace and
	      well being. It is evident, therefore that this particular aspect of the
	      Hajj is of considerable importance as it centers on the great act of forgiveness.</p>
	    <p> In seeking a more complete and perfect submission to Allah the pilgrim
	      is encouraged and enlivened by the forgiveness received and the opportunity
	      of beginning anew.</p>
	    <p> A second ritual which is integral to the purpose of the Hajj and likewise
	      of profound significance is the commemoration of the festival of sacrifice "Id-ul-Adha".
	      This festival is one of the most important events on the Islamic calendar.
	      It commemorates the obedience and submission of Ibrahim when he was called
	      to sacrifice his son Isma'il.</p>
	    <p> The preparedness to obey and submit to the will of Allah regardless
	      of the cost makes Ibrahim a model for the Muslim to follow and commemorating
	      the festival of sacrifice highlights the significance of this disposition.
	      The ultimate goal of Islam is submission to Allah and the example of Ibrahim
	      is regarded as one of complete and perfect submission. The significance
	      of this festival is that it expresses for the Muslim pilgrim the absolute
	      and perfect submission to Allah to which all devout Muslims aspire. Accordingly,
	      it is difficult to overstate the significance of "Id-ul-Adha" for
	      the faith of a Muslim pilgrim and indeed for the wider Muslim community.
	      While "Id-ul-Adha" is an integral part of the Hajj, it is
	      commemorated by all Muslims, not just those undertaking the Hajj.</p>
	    <p> A third ritual, the stoning of the pillars at Mina is also connected
	      to the story of Ibrahim and Isma'il. Tradition tells that Ibrahim
	      was visited by the devil on his way to sacrifice Isma'il and tempted
	      to abandon the task. The devil argued persuasively, however, Ibrahim remained
	      obedient to Allah and rejected the devil's temptation, ultimately
	      driving the devil away with stones.</p>
	    <p> Pilgrims on the Hajj throw stones at the pillars at Mina which symbolise
	      the devil. In the ritual of throwing stones at the pillars, Muslims are
	      emulating the rejection of the devil and the reality of temptation in
	      their own lives. Thus the significance of the stoning ritual is the emphasis
	      on the rejection of the devil's temptation. Temptation is an obstacle
	      to the goal of submission and must be overcome. In rejecting the devil
	      the Muslim is able to more sincerely submit to the will of Allah. Thus
	      the ritual of stoning the pillars has significance in its representation
	      of the struggle against temptation and the ultimate goal of submission
	      to Allah. This fundamental goal of Islam underpins the ritual of the stoning
	      and highlights its profound significance.</p>
	    <p> In the course of the Hajj, pilgrims walk between Marwah and Safa to
	      commemorate Hajar's search for water in the desert. Ultimately the
	      angel Jibril appeared and showed her the location of the spring now known
	      as the well of Zamzam. This revelation saved the life of Hajar and her
	      son Isma'il. Muslims see in this story the call to seek the things
	      in life which are of true value as well as the assurance that ultimately
	      Allah will provide what is needed.</p>
	    <p> For Muslims, these are important realities and their acknowledgement
	      greatly assists their submission to Allah. Thus, like other rituals of
	      the Hajj, the rituals relating to Hajar's search for water are significant
	      in their connection to the ultimate goal of submission to Allah.</p>
	    <p> The circling of the Ka'bah which occurs at the beginning and end
	      of the Hajj is a further example of a ritual which expresses the element
	      of obedience and submission to the will of Allah. The requirement to undertake
	      the Hajj is written in the Qur'an and the circling of the Ka'bah
	      is essentially a statement of obedience to this requirement. The Hajj
	      is a fundamental requirement of Islam, prescribed by the Qur'an.
	      In the context of the faith of Islam there are few things that could be
	      considered of greater significance.</p>
	    <p> In addition to the rituals particular to the Hajj, there are a number
	      of other aspects which are of significance. For example, the amount of
	      commitment and dedication required to undertake the Hajj is of itself
	      a significant element.</p>
	    <p> The Hajj also provides a very significant experience of community. Over
	      two million pilgrims take part in the Hajj each year. They come from all
	      regions of the world and represent virtually every nationality. The experience
	      of the Hajj is a significant expression of the diversity of Islam, yet
	      at the same time it is a powerful witness to the unity of Islam with millions
	      of people, of every race and nationality uniting together in one goal
	      of submission to Allah.</p>
	    <p> In conclusion, it is evident that the Hajj is an event of profound significance
	      for the Muslim. The rituals of the Hajj and the events that they commemorate
	      express some of the fundamental beliefs of Islam. Therefore, the pilgrim,
	      in undertaking the Hajj is engaging with these core beliefs.</p>
	    <p> The ultimate goal of Islam is submission to Allah. Submission to Allah
	      is the central purpose of the Hajj. Each aspect, every ritual leads to
	      a greater and more perfect submission on the part of the pilgrim. Therefore,
	      the Hajj, the rituals involved and their meaning are of the greatest significance
	      to the Muslim in their ultimate goal of submission to Allah.</p>
