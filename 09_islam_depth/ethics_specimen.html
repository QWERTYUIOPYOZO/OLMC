            <p><b>Question 4 - Islam (15 marks)</b></p>
	        <p><b> (a) Describe Islamic ethical teachings on ONE of the following:
	            (3)</b></p>
	        <ul>
	          <li><strong>bioethics </strong></li>
	          <li><strong>environmental ethics </strong></li>
	          <li><strong>sexual ethics</strong></li>
        </ul>
	        <p> Ethical teachings in Islam include teachings of the care for and
	          protection of the environment. These teachings are found in all the
            major sources of Islamic teachings, the Qur'an, Hadith and Shari'ah.</p>
	        <p> The Qur'an provides a number of specific references to environmental
	          issues as well as providing some underlying principles such as the
	          notion of khalifa which bestows guardianship of the environment on
	          humankind..</p>
	        <p> The Hadith also provides a number of specific teachings together
	          with the reiteration of important principles expressed in the Qur'an.
	          Finally, Islamic law, known as Shari'ah contains many examples
	          of teaching relating to the environment.</p>
	        <p> The basic principles found in the Qur'an show that the environment
	          is a gift from Allah and is to be cared for by human beings who are
	          regarded as trustees or guardians.</p>
	        <p> Other teachings on the environment are based on this principle.
	          These include teachings relating to the use and conservation of water
	          found in the Hadiths and teachings on hunting and animal welfare explained
	          in Shari'ah law.</p>
	        <p> Islamic teaching also affirms the integrity and balance which exists
	          in creation and recognises it as a sacred thing which must be respected.
	          Muslims believe that they will be called to give account of their
	          actions in relation to the environment.</p>

            <p><b>(b) Explain Islamic ethical teachings on ONE of the following:

              <li><strong>sexual ethics</strong></li>
        </ul>
	        <p> The religion of Islam provides clear ethical teachings on issues
	          relating to the environment. These teachings are found in all the
            major sources of Islamic teachings, the Qur'an, Hadith and Shari'ah.</p>
	        <p> While Islamic teachings does not specifically address many of the
	          modern environmental concerns, it does, however, provide clear guiding
	          principles which can be applied to these issues.</p>
	        <p> The Qur'an provides some specific teaching on environmental
	          concerns but principally it sets forth values and principles which
	          can be applied to a range of issues. The principles set down in the
	          Qur'an include the notion that the environment is a gift from
	          Allah and that human beings have been given a responsibility as guardians
	          (khalifa) of the environment.</p>
	        <p> The resources of the earth are available to be used for the needs
	          of human kind but this use is intended to be nurturing and sustaining,
	          not exploitative and destructive. The Qur'an also teaches that
	          Muslims will have to answer for their action in relation to the environment
	          at the time of judgement.</p>
	        <p> The Qur'an shows that there is a profound relationship between
	          creation and the creator and accordingly there is a sacredness in
	          the created world which should not be violated through selfish exploitation
	          and needless destruction. This relationship also reflects the diversity
	          and balance which exists in creation. Human beings are called to honour
	          the sanctity of the environment and respect its diversity and harmony.</p>
	        <p> The traditions of the Hadith reiterate the teaching of the Qur'an
	          and include some important teachings on matters such as the use and
	          conservation of water. Shari'ah law contains teachings on many
	          environmental concerns such as hunting and the welfare of animals,
	          the use of land, protection of forests etc.</p>
	        <p> Muslims understand that there is a close relationship between environmental
	          concerns and issues of justice. The believe that in order to properly
	          address environmental concerns there must be a change of heart in
	          individuals and a transformation in societies.</p>
	        <p> In other words, it cannot be expected that genuine progress will
	          be made in protection of the environment while individual and communities
	          and pre-occupied with self fulfillment with little regard for others.</p>

	        <p><b>(c) Analyse Islamic ethical teachings with reference to ONE
        significant area (</b><b>6)</b></p>
	        <p> The religion of Islam provides clear ethical teachings on issues
	          relating to the environment. The teachings found in all the major
	          sources of Islamic teachings, the Qur'an, Hadith and Shari'ah
	          are the basis for the Muslim understanding of their relationship and
            responsibility to the environment.</p>
	        <p> While Islamic teachings does not specifically address many of the
	          modern environmental concerns, it does, however, provide clear guiding
	          principles which can are applied to issues and as a consequence inform
	          the understanding of Muslims on a range of environmental issues.</p>
	        <p> The Qur'an provides some specific teaching on environmental
	          concerns but principally it sets forth values and principles which

	          (khalifa) of the environment.</p>
	        <p> The notion of khalifa is, therefore, one of the guiding principles
	          of Islamic ethical teahing. The resources of the earth are available
	          to be used for the needs of human kind but this use is intended to
	          be nurturing and sustaining, not exploitative and destructive.</p>

            <p>(approx 350 words)</p>
            <p><b>Question 4 - Islam </b><b> (20 marks)</b></p>
	        <p><b> Describe and explain Islamic ethical teachings on ONE of
	            the following: </b></p>
	        <ul>
              <li><strong>bioethics </strong></li>
              <li><strong>environmental ethics </strong></li>
              <li><strong>sexual ethics</strong></li>
        </ul>
	        <p> Teaching on the care of the environment is found within all the
	          major sources of Islam. Principally the Qur'an has a number of specific
	          references to ecology and also contains some important principles
	          which are able to be applied to the environment. The tradition of
	          the Prophet Muhammad (Hadith) has a number of other important statements.
	          Finally, Shari'ah law includes many teachings which explain
	          the application of Qur'anic principles to areas not specifically addressed
            in the Qur'an.</p>
	        <p> Thus, collectively, the sources of authority in Islam provide clear
	          teaching and direction to Muslims in their relationship with the environment.</p>
	        <p> Environmental concerns are substantially of a modern nature and
	          in many cases relate to issues which are peculiar to an industrialised
	          world. Issues such as over population, global warming etc belong
	          to recent generations. It is unreasonable, therefore, to expect
	          the sources of an ancient religion to deal specifically with these
	          modern issues. However, Islamic scholars have found that the principles
	          of Muslim life do provide very clear guidance in relation to these
	          issues. Therefore, while some environmental issues are addressed
	          in specific terms through Muslim sources, other teachings are drawn
	          from the application of fundamental principles to modern concerns.</p>
	        <p> The first principle which guides Islamic teaching on ecology is
	          the notion of trusteeship. The term "khalifa" means trustee
	          and guardian and it refers to the understanding that in creating the
	          world Allah has placed creation in the trust of human beings.</p>
	        <p> The tradition of the Prophet Muhammad states "The world is
	          green and beautiful, and Allah has appointed you his guardian over
	          it" (Hadith). This guardianship "kahlifa" involves
	          the appropriate use of the world's resources for the needs of humankind
	          but in a way which nurtures and sustains the environment. The environment
	          is seen not as the property of human beings but as their responsibility
	          to care for and nurture.</p>
	        <p> Another principle is that of "tawhid". Tawhid refers principally
	          to the unity and absolute oneness of Allah yet by extension it
	          includes the unity and oneness of that which is created by Allah.
	          The unity of Allah is clearly reflected in the integrity of the
	          created world and the principle of "tawhid" demands that
	          the integrity of the created world is maintained and respected.</p>
	        <p> A third principle is that of accountability "akrah". Muslims
	          understand that they will be judged by Allah for the way they have
	          undertaken their responsibilities. This will include a judgement
	          concerning how they have acted in relation to the environment.
	          Muslims believe that they will be questioned by Allah on the way they
	          carried our their responsibilities towards all aspects of creation. </p>
	        <p> "It is He that has made you custodians, inheritors of the earth" (surah
	          6:165). This surah enunciates the principles of human beings as "khalifa" or
	          custodians of the earth. It is one of the important texts which clearly
	          state the relationship between humankind and the rest of creation.
	          It also highlights that this relationship of responsibility has been
	          ordained by Allah or in other word is the will of Allah.</p>
	        <p> Another example setting out this relationship is found in surah
	          45:12-13 which speaks of all that is the heavens and the earth being
	          subjected to humankind. While human beings have the use of the resources
	          of the world, they do not have a right to exploit or destroy these
	          resources. Their use of the world's resources should be in keeping
	          with the nurturing and sustaining responsibilities of their guardianship. </p>
	        <p> The Qur'an cleary conveys the important elements of the diversity
	          and balance that exists in nature. Human beings have a fundamental
	          responsibility to use the world's resources in a way which does not
	          diminish the diversity of creation or threaten the balance and harmony
	          that exists. </p>
	        <p> The degree of control that human beings can exercise over creation
	          is tempered by the Qur'an recognising that human beings are
	          only one aspect of the wonder of creation. "Greater indeed than
	          the creation of man is the creation of the heavens and the earth." (surah
	          40:57). This text clearly speaks against the possibility of reckless
	          or complete domination of the natural world for the benefit of human
	          beings. In fact it has been used to show that an anthropocentric view
	          of creation is incompatible with the teaching of the Qur'an. </p>
	        <p> The tradition of the Prophet Muhammad shows clearly that he held
	          a deep concern for the natural environment and encouraged Muslims
	          to treat it with respect and to nurture is with care and concern for
	          the future. The most well known of the Hadiths relating to the environment
	          states "the earth is green and beautiful and Allah has appointed
	          you his stewards over it".</p>
	        <p> A further example from the tradition of the Prophet Muhammad says "the
	          whole earth has been created a place of worship, pure and clean".
	          By acknowledging that the earth is a place of worship, the Prophet
	          Muhammad is recognising it as a sacred entity. To act in a way that
	          is harmful to the environment is akin to defiling a place of worship
	          which would be a serious affront to Allah and to all Muslims.</p>
	        <p> The environment is intended to provide for the needs of human beings
	          and human beings are meant to work with the environment to ensure
	          its sustainability. "If a Muslim plants a tree or sow and field
	          and humans and beasts and birds eat from it, all of it is love
	          on his part" (Hadith).</p>
	        <p> Many environmental concerns are modern issues of a post industrialised
	          world and were not envisaged at the time of the revelation of the
	          Qur'an. Accordingly, the application of Shari'ah law is
	          extremely relevant and important in Muslim teaching on the environment.</p>
	        <p> Muslim teaching prevents hunting other than to provide for the needs
	          of the community and there are laws providing for the most humane
	          way of killing animals where it is necessary. There are also teachings
	          about the welfare of animals which relate to the keeping of animals
	          in confinement. Animals should not be tied up or kept in unsuitably
	          small spaces. They must also be kept in clean and sanitary surroundings.</p>
	        <p> The use of animals for scientific experiments is a matter of some
	          concern and debate. In general, Islamic teaching would oppose experimentation
	          on animals other than those that seek to bring genuinely needed benefits
	          to humanity and only then after careful consideration of all alternatives.
	          Testing of cosmetic products on animals is not condoned.</p>
	        <p> There are many situations that have been addressed in the development
	          of Shari'ah laws. These include laws governing the growth and
	          size of cities, appropriate uses for land, prohibitions against overstocking
	          grazing, the protection of forests and wildlife and many other issues.</p>
	        <p> For Muslims, the current extremes in environmental degradation parallel
	          the worst excesses of materialism and secularism. They show a contempt
	          for the environment which is in effect a contempt for the creator
	          and a contempt for the natural order.</p>
	        <p> The ecological crisis is seen as both a sign and a symptom of an
	          attitude where the individual seeks to selfishly satisfy their own
	          wants with little or no regard for others. Such an attitude is ultimately
	          self destructive as it results in the exploitation of the world's
	          resources, the exploitation of other people and the loss of human
	          dignity and true human values.</p>
	        <p> Muslims believe that the solution to the modern environmental crisis
	          will be found only in a radical transformation of values and ultimately
	          submission to the will of Allah. It is not sufficient to simply speak
	          of ecological measures which superficially address the symptoms without
	          also addressing the fundamental causes of the crisis.</p>
