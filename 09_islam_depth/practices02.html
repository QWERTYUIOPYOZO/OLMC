		<h1>Content Description</h1>
		<h2>How the Hajj expresses the beliefs of Islam</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Surrender to Allah</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The <b>essence of Islam</b> is surrender to Allah. This surrender
		  is epitomised in undertaking the Hajj. For Muslims this pilgrimage
		    captures their <b>desire</b> and their <b>commitment</b> to surrender
		  themselves fully to Allah.</p>
		  <p>The Hajj requires considerable <b>sacrifice and commitment</b> on
		    the part of the pilgrim and this assists them to attain the appropriate
		    inner disposition of surrender. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Examples of submission</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The rituals associated with the Hajj relate to a number of <b>important
encounters</b> between Allah and humankind in ancient times. These encounters
are foundational in understanding the relationship between Allah and humanity
and Muslims undertaking the Hajj are seeking to emulate the extent of submission
displayed by their ancestors in these ancient times.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Forgiveness and restoration</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>These encounters include the <b>restoration of Adam and Eve</b> and
		    Allah's forgiveness after their disobedience, the <b>submission
		    of Ibrahim</b> in being willing to sacrifice Isma'il and the
		    provision of the Zamzam spring for Hajar and Isma'il in the desert.</p>
		  <p>The <b>ritual
		      actions of the Hajj</b> are based on these significant
    moments of encounter with Allah and the <b>core beliefs of Islam</b> are
    expressed and affirmed in undertaking these rituals. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>The Stand Before Allah</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Wuquf</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The stand or the <b>stand before Allah</b> known as <b>"wuquf"</b> is
		    the central moment of the Hajj. Pilgrims gather at the <b>Mount of Mercy</b> on
		    the plain of Arafat near Mina on 9 Dhul-Hijjah. The stand takes place from <b>midday
		    until sunset</b>. Pilgrims meditate, pray and concentrate their thoughts
	      on Allah during the stand.</p>
		  <p>A <b>sermon is preached</b> on the top of Arafat after which
		    the pilgrims spend the night in <b>thanksgiving.</b> </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Adam and Eve's restoration</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>According to the tradition, the Mount of Mercy is the place where Adam and Eve,
realising their sin of disobedience, sought <b>restoration and forgiveness.</b> They
were forgiven and restored to <b>union with Allah</b>. In response
to Allah's goodness and forgiveness, Adam and Eve then built a shrine which
is believed to be the first building constructed in human history. Appropriately,
the building was a <b>shrine dedicated to the worship of Allah</b>. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Forgiveness of sins</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Muslims believe that just as Adam and Eve received the forgiveness of
		    Allah at Arafat, so they too can enjoy the <b>forgiveness of their
		    sins</b> and experience the <b>beginning of a new life</b>.
		    Sincere repentance as part of the Hajj wipes away all past sin and allows
		    the Muslim pilgrim to feel totally cleansed and free from past transgression.
		    Effectively, it means a new start and a great sense of <b>peace and
	      wellbeing</b> in perfect surrender to Allah. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>The Feast of Sacrifice</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Id-ul-Adha</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The day after the stand before Allah is the <b>day of sacrifice</b> "Id-ul-Adha".
		  It is the <b>major festival</b> of the Muslim calendar commemorating
		  the events around the time when Ibrahim was called to sacrifice Isma'il
		  and <b>overcame the temptations of the devil</b>. Although part
		  of the Hajj ritual "Id-ul-Adha" is celebrated by all Muslims,
		  not just those taking part in the Hajj.</p>
		  <p>The celebration of <b>Id-ul-Adha</b> involves the <b>ritual
		      sacrifice</b> of
  an animal. The sacrifice calls to mind the <b>Ibrahim's surrender
  to Allah</b> in resisting the temptations of the devil and being prepared
  to sacrifice his son Isma'il in <b>obedience to Allah</b>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Temptations</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The tradition tells that Ibrahim was <b>visited by the devil</b> as
		    he set out for Mina in obedience to Allah. In the visitation, the
		    devil argued powerfully that Ibrahim did not need to sacrifice Isma'il
		    and even attempted to convince Ibrahim that he was deluded in thinking
		    that Allah had demanded such a sacrifice from him.</p>
		  <p>Ibrahim, however, remained <b>faithful to Allah</b> and
		    continued on his way to offer Isma'il as sacrifice only to be stopped
		    by Allah at the last moment. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Sacrifice of wants &amp; needs</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The sacrifice offered during the celebration if Id-ul-Adha symbolises
		    the preparedness of Muslims to <b>sacrifice all</b> personal
		    needs, wants and aspirations in <b>service of Allah</b>. Indeed,
		    the extreme nature of the call to sacrifice Isma'il is a reminder
		    that a Muslim's life is totally
at the service of Allah and the <b>requirement of surrender</b> is
absolute, even to the cost of one's own life if necessary.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Hajar's Thirst</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Hajar and Isma'il</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The third significant encounter with Allah is centered on the tradition
		    of Hajar and Isma'il's wandering in the desert <b>looking
		    for water</b>. Due to Sarah's jealousy towards Hajar and Isma'il,
	      Ibrahim separates from them, leaving them in the <b>care of Allah</b>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Well of Zamzam</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Hajar and Isma'il then faced a <b>testing time</b> in
		    the desert looking for either a spring or a passing camel caravan so that
		    they had some water to drink. Hajar ran back and forth between the hills
		    of Safa and Marwah looking for water, however, her search was futile until
		    the <b>angel
		  Jibril</b> appeared and showed her the spring which is now known as
		  the <b>well of Zamzam</b>.		  </p>
		  <p> The spring soon became the <b>water supply</b> for many desert
  travelers and ultimately the <b>city of Makkah</b> came to be built
  at the location.</p>
The revealing of the spring is seen as another example of the <b>providence
of Allah</b>, coming to the aid of Hajar and Isma'il at the greatest
time of need.</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>True and lasting value</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> As part of the ritual of the Hajj, pilgrims travel on the walkway between
		    the hills of <b>Safa and Marwah</b>. This action symbolises the
		    search for the things of true and lasting value to the Muslim and
		    the ultimate realisation that <b>Allah will provide</b> all that
		    is needed. Pilgrims take water from the well of Zamzam to drink and to
		    take home with them. Some also dip their clothes in the water. These clothes
	      are often then kept to be used as burial shrouds.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Stoning of the Pillars</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Mina</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The rejection of the temptation of the devil is symbolised by pilgrims
		    in hurling stones at the pillars (jamaras) at Mina. These pillars represent
		    the places where <b>Ibrahim resisted the temptations</b> and <b>stoned
	      the devil.</b></p>
		  <p>Muslims today carry out a <b>ritual stoning</b> of
		    the devil to symbolise their rejection of temptation and surrender
		    to Allah.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Circling of the Ka'bah</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Ka'bah</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The circling of the Ka'bah is another ritual expressing <b>obedience
		    and submission to the will of Allah</b>. The pilgrims circle the Ka'bah
	      indicating their obedience to the call to complete the Hajj.</p>
		  <p>The preparedness
		    to come to Makkah and complete the Hajj is in itself a symbol of
		    a Muslim's
		    surrender and dedication to Allah. It sums up the <b>essence
  of Islam</b> and conveys in the deepest sense the purpose of the Hajj.</p>
