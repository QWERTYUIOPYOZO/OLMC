	    <p><b> Question 4 - Islam (15 marks)</b></p>
	    <p><b> Outline the contribution of ONE significant person or school
	        or thought to Islam (3)</b></p>
	    <p> Al-Ghazali was a highly respected teacher and prolific writer from the
	      late eleventh and early twelfth centuries. His reputation led him to be
	      known as "the Proof of Islam".</p>
	    <p> He taught and wrote extensively in the fields of theology, philosophy,
	      law and mysticism. From each of these areas he drew positive elements
	      which he used to explain important beliefs of Islam as well as providing
	      critiques of dubious ideas and practices that he found incompatible with
	      Islam.</p>
	    <p> Through his writings, Al-Ghazali developed a synthesis of ideas from
	      across a range of fields and strands of Islam. This has had the effect
	      of providing a stronger and more mature understanding of the Muslim faith.</p>
	    <p> Al-Ghazali also adopted the mysticism of the Sufi movement. He did so
	      principally because he found that there was a limit to knowledge that
	      could be gained through rational means. His patronage of the Sufi movement
	      allowed Sufism to develop an acceptance and credibility among other
	      groups within Islam. (approx 150 words)</p>
	    <p><b> Explain the effect of ONE significant person or school or
	        thought on Islam (6)</b></p>
	    <p> Al-Ghazali was a respected teacher and a prolific writer from the late
	      eleventh and early twelfth centuries. His effect on the religion of Islam
	      is seen in his synthesis of the disciplines of theology, philosophy, law
	      and mysticism in a way that provided a clearer and more mature understanding
	      of Muslim faith.</p>
	    <p> By critiquing studies theology, philosophy, law and mysticism Al-Ghazali
	      was able to identify and bring out the best feature of each. His critiques
	      also enabled him to draw attention to dubious teachings and practices.</p>
	    <p> Through adopting this approach with all strands of thought and ideas
	      in Islam, Al-Ghazali attracted criticism from the proponents of these
	      ideas, yet he was also able to make use of the best of each approach for
	      the greater good of Islam.</p>
	    <p> His critiques of theology, principally found in the Munqidh drew attention
	      to the rational shortcomings of both Ash'arite and Isma'ilite
	      theology. His critiques of philosophy, especially certain aspects of metaphysics
	      is found principally in the Tahafut.</p>
	    <p> Although being attracted to Sufism himself. Al-Ghazali nevertheless,
	      critiqued Sufi practices as well and in particular criticised elements
	      within Sufism which disregarded the obligations of Shari'ah law.</p>
	    <p> The patronage of Al-Ghazali led to Sufism gaining a far greater acceptance
	      and respect within Islam and has ensured that is has been able to continue
	      to grow and develop as a significant element in the Islamic world. While
	      Al-Ghazali was critical of some aspects of Sufi practice, he nevertheless
	      embraced the movement and he is now regarded as one of its most influential
	      members.</p>
	    <p> The capacity of Al-Ghazali to be at once critical and supportive of
	      ways of thinking was one of his greatest attributes. He was able to critique
	      the areas of concern and adopt aspect which had value. This approach was
	      in stark contrast to the tendency to take up one position and vigorously
	      defend it against all others which prevailed at the time.</p>
	    <p> Al-Ghazali's measured use of different schools of thought allowed
	      him to avoid the type of partisan conflict that accompanied much of
	      the scholarly development of Islam at the time. His reputation is such
	      that his is regarded as one of the greatest teachers in the history
	      of Islam and is known as "the Proof of Islam". (approx 375

	    <p> Al-Ghazali was a respected teacher and a prolific writer from the late
	      eleventh and early twelfth centuries. He is known as "the Proof
	      of Islam" a title which indicates the degree of respect for him
	      in Islamic circles. Some modern scholars regard him as the greatest teacher
	      in the history of Islam though at his own time he was often criticized
	      by his contemporaries.</p>

	      and ideas of his time and take the best from each while not being burdened
	      with their shortcomings.</p>

	    <p><b> Question 4 - Islam </b><b> (20 marks)</b></p>
	    <p><b> Describe the contribution and analyse the effect of ONE significant
	        person or school or thought on Islam</b></p>
	    <p> The impact of Al-Ghazali on the development of Islam can be seen in
	      his accomplished synthesis of the areas of theology, philosophy, law and
	      mysticism. He has made significant contributions to each of these disciplines
	      yet his most profound impact has been his ability to bring out the best
	      from all these disciplines and strands of Islam in a way that provided
	      strength and maturity to Islamic thought.</p>
	    <p> His prolific writing and highly regarded teaching has ensured that he
	      has had considerable impact on the religion of Islam. His impact, while
	      significant during his own time has continued to grow over the centuries
	      and he is now regarded by many modern scholars as the greatest teacher
	      in the history of Islam.</p>
	    <p> Al-Ghazali's reputation and contribution to Islam is summed up
	      in the title by which he is widely known. He is known as "the Proof
	      of Islam", a title which recognises the extent and quality of his
	      teaching.</p>
	    <p> Al-Gahzali undertook critiques of all the main ideas and schools of
	      thought at the time. These critiques included criticisms of some elements
	      of Ash'arite as well as Isma'ilite theology which were the
	      basis of the Sunni and Shi'a strands respectively.</p>
	    <p> His criticisms resulted in Al-Ghazali being opposed by the various groups
	      of Islam. However, it also allowed him to develop his critical synthesis
	      of ideas which would become on of his most significant contributions
	      to Islam.</p>
	    <p> His critique of Ash'arite theology, principally contained in "the
	      Munqidh" was based on the making of assumptions or presuppositions
	      which had no rational basis. He challenged the notion that the Qur'an
	      was uncreated and therefore the very speech of Allah. He questioned the
	      understanding of anthropomorphic images in the Qur'an and the idea
	      that eschatological images should be accepted at face value rather than
	      being regarded as metaphors. Al-Ghazali also challenged an understanding
	      of free will which taught that Allah creates the acts of the individuals
	      who simply acquire them.</p>
	    <p> He criticised Isma'ilite theology, in particular the relationship
	      of knowledge to the teaching of the infallible Imam. The Isma'ilites
	      held that all knowledge on any point must come from the teaching of the
	      infallible Imam.</p>
	    <p> The second element of Al-Ghazali's work was his writings on the
	      influential philosophers of his time </p>
	    <p> The work of the Greek philosophers Aristotle and Plato and the writings
	      of Muslim philosophers such as al-Farabi and Avicenna held a great deal
	      of interest for Al-Ghazali. There had been considerable interest in Islam
	      concerning the writings of the philosophers, however, by the time of Al-Ghazali,
	      there was a considerable backlash against Hellenistic ideas. It is likely
	      therefore that Al-Ghazali's study of the philosophers would have
	      been done secretly.</p>
	    <p> Al-Ghazali was able to bring the same balanced critique to philosophy
	      that he had brought to his study of theology. As a consequence of this
	      he was able to point out areas of concern while at the same time embracing
	      and making use of its positive elements.</p>
	    <p> On one hand Al-Ghazali could see great potential for the use of philosophical
	      thought to provide insight into and explanation of Muslim ideas. On the
	      other hand, he was wary about aspects of philosophy which were not in
	      harmony with Muslim beliefs.</p>
	    <p> His concerns were mostly in the area of metaphysics where three key
	      concepts drew his criticism. The first was that there was no resurrection
	      for the body and that resurrection was a spiritual reality only. Secondly
	      that the knowledge of Allah is limited to universal aspects and that Allah
	      does not have knowledge of particulars. Thirdly that the world had existed
	      for all time and was therefore not created.</p>
	    <p> Al-Ghazali's study of philosophy led him to find considerable
	      value in the use of Aristotelian syllogisms which he frequently used in
	      explaining Muslim ideas. This technique has provided considerable opportunities
	      for the development of learning in Islam and has helped to provide a rational
	      basis for many aspects of Muslim belief.</p>
	    <p> Al-Ghazali found himself drawn to Sufi mysticism because he believed
	      that there was a limit to the knowledge that could be gained through rational
	      means and that higher learning could only be achieved through mystical
	      disciplines. While he embraced the Sufi way of life, he remained critical
	      of some Sufi practices which disregarded the obligations of Shari'ah
	      law.</p>
	    <p> He wrote the enormous and important forty volume work known as the Ihya
	      which systematically tracked the relationship between the authentic Sufi
	      life and the requirements of Shari'ah law. The Ihya had enormous
	      importance for the future of Sufism. The Sufi way of life had often been
	      criticised by other Muslims to the extent that some Sufi leaders had even
	      been executed as unbelievers and enemies of Islam.</p>
	    <p> The patronage of Al-Ghazali led to Sufism gaining a far greater acceptance
	      and respect within Islam and has ensured that is has been able to continue
	      to grow and develop as a significant element in the Islamic world.
	      While Al-Ghazali was critical of some aspects of Sufi practice, he
	      nevertheless embraced the movement and he is now regarded as one of its
	      most influential members.</p>
	    <p> The capacity of Al-Ghazali to be at once critical and supportive of
	      ways of thinking was one of his greatest attributes. Rather than a wholesale
	      rejection of an approach which was flawed, he was able to critique the
	      areas of concern and adopt aspect which had value. This approach was in
	      stark contrast to the tendency to take up one position and vigorously
	      defend it against all others which prevailed at the time.</p>
	    <p> Al-Ghazali's measured use of different schools of thought allowed
	      him to avoid the type of partisan conflict that accompanied much of the
	      scholarly development of Islam at the time.</p>
	    <p> An additional element of Al-Ghazali's work, arising from this
	      approach, was his ability to synthesise the ideas of the main strands
	      of Islamic thought. This provided considerable impetus in allowing
	      the traditions of Islam to develop with clarity and relative harmony
	      which may not have been possible otherwise. Through Al-Ghazali's
	      contribution, Islam has developed a maturity that allows it to accept
	      the best from its diverse strands rather than seeking to annihilate
	      the other through religious and political rivalry.</p>
	    <p> Al-Ghazali had a distinguished career as both a teacher and a writer.
	      He held professorships at the prestigious Nizamiyya colleges in both Baghdad
	      and Nishapur. The role at Baghdad was perhaps the most important teaching
	      position in the Sunni Islamic world.</p>
	    <p> There are over 70 extant works which are attributed to Al-Ghazali and
	      although many of them are disputed, he was, nevertheless, a prolific writer.
	      His most important works dealt with theology, philosophy, law and mysticism</p>
	    <p> It is evident, therefore, through his distinguished teaching career
	      and prolific writing that Al-Ghazali, the Proof of Islam has had a profound
	      impact on the life of Islam. His searching critiques of theology, philosophy,
	      law and mysticism are highly regarded by many modern scholars, some of
	      whom regard him to be the greatest teacher in the history of Islam.</p>
	    <p> His synthesis of ideas from all strands and approaches of Islam has
	      led to a maturity and strengthening of Muslim teaching and facilitated
	      a way for the groups within Islam to grow together in relative harmony.
