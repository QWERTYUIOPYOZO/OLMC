                                           <li> The early period of Islam (632-661)
                                             is that of the rightly guided caliphs

                                             of Islam Shi'a Muslims accept

                                           <li> Give him the title of Imam which
                                             indicates that he was a divinely

                                           <li> Led to divisions between three

                                           <li> Sought to find a way of detachment

                                             world in favour of a spiritual search. </li>
                                           <li> Often regarded as heretical sect </li>

                                           <li> Some Sufis were executed because
                                             they were considered as unbelievers

                                           <li> Sufism was neither a strand of

                                           <li> Sufism found acceptance in Islam
                                             through the reputation of Al-Ghazali

                                           <li> Al-Ghazali's patronage
                                             of Sufism provided a great deal
                                             of credibility to the movement </li>
                                           <li> Classical Greek philosophy had

                                             was a powerful backlash against
                                             Hellenistic thought </li>
                                           <li> Islamic philosophers such as
                                             al-Farabi and Avicenna had made
                                             detailed study of the Greek philosophers </li>
                                           <li> Gone to great lengths to show
                                             that their thinking was compatible
                                             with Islam </li>
                                           <li> By the time of Al-Ghazali there
                                             was considerable suspicion about
                                             the work of the Greek philosophers                                             </li>
                                           <li>Consequently the work of al-Farabi
                                               and Avicenna was discredited</li>

                                           <li> Greek philosophy and the writings

                                             and Avicenna held a great deal of

                                           <li> Could see great potential for
                                             the use of philosophical thought

                                           <li> Concerns were mostly in the area
                                             of metaphysics </li>
                                           <li> Identified twenty points of conflict
                                             between metaphysics and the beliefs
                                             of Islam Three key concepts underpinned
                                             these twenty concerns </li>
                                           <li> The first was that there was
                                             no resurrection for the body and
                                             that resurrection was a spiritual
                                             reality only </li>
                                           <li> Secondly that the knowledge of
                                             Allah is limited to universal aspects
                                             and that Allah does not have knowledge
                                             of particulars </li>
                                           <li> Thirdly that the world had existed
                                             for all time and was therefore not
                                             created </li>
                                           <li> Found considerable value in the
                                             use of Aristotelian syllogisms </li>
                                           <li> He frequently used them in explaining
                                             Muslim ideas </li>
                                           <li> Capacity to be at once critical
                                             and supportive of ways of thinking
                                             was one of his greatest attributes </li>
                                           <li> Rather than rejection of an approach
                                             which was flawed, he was able to
                                             critique the areas of concern and
                                             adopt aspect which had value </li>
                                           <li> This was in contrast to the tendency
                                             to take up one position and vigorously
                                             defend it against all others which
                                             prevailed at the time </li>
                                           <li> Measured use of different schools
                                             of thought allowed him to avoid
                                             the type of partisan conflict that
                                             accompanied much of the scholarly
                                             development of Islam at the time </li>
                                           <li> Able to synthesise the ideas
                                             of the main strands of Islamic thought </li>
                                           <li> Provided impetus in allowing
                                             the traditions of Islam to develop
                                             with clarity and relative harmony
                                             which may not have been possible
