		<h1>Content Description </h1>
		<h2>The contribution of Al-Ghazali to the development and expression of Islam </h2>
		<h3>Background and Context of Al-Ghazali's Life and Work</h3>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Four Caliphs</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The early period of Islam (632-661) is known as the period
		    of the rightly guided caliphs (<b>Al-Khulafa' Al Rashidun</b>).
		    The four caliphs are accepted by Sunni Muslims as the <b>authentic
		    leaders</b> of Islam in what is considered to be a golden age or ideal
		    period of Muslim development. <b>Shi'a Muslims</b> accept
		    only the fourth of these leaders 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib as a <b>rightful
		    leader</b> and give him the title of Imam which indicates that he
	      was a divinely guided leader.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Groups within Islam</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The following period saw the rule of the <b>Umayyad group</b> and
		    then later of the <b>Abbasids</b>. This period led to divisions
		    between three main groupings of Muslims. The <b>Sunni and Shi'a
		    groups</b> have continued until the present times. The third group
		    the Khajirites were a more radical separatist group which has not
		    continued in significant numbers other than a reformed and more moderate
	      group of Khajirites known as Ibadi.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Sufism</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>A further movement in Islam, the <b>Sufi movement</b>, arose in
		    the late seventh century and sought to find a way of detachment from the
	      material values of the world in favour of a <b>spiritual search</b>.</p>
		  <p>Sufis
		    were often regarded as an heretical sect with accusations that they
		    disregarded the requirements of Shari'ah law. Some significant Sufis
		    were executed because they were <b>considered as unbelievers and enemies of Islam</b>.
  Sufism was neither a strand of the Sunni or Shi'a groups of Islam, it
  had followers in both groups. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Credibility</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Sufism was to eventually find credibility and greater acceptance in
		    Islam due to the <b>reputation of Al-Ghazali</b> as a great scholar
		    and devout Muslims. Al-Ghazali's patronage of Sufism provided a great
	      deal of <b>credibility</b> to the movement.</p>
		  <p>Classical Greek philosophy,
		    especially the work of <b>Aristotle and Plato</b> had
  also gained considerable influence in Islam at the time of Al-Ghazali's
  life and work although there was a powerful <b>backlash</b> against
  Hellenistic thought. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Greek philosophy</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Some notable Islamic philosophers such as <b>al-Farabi and Avicenna</b> had
		    made detailed study of the Greek philosophers and had gone to great lengths
	      to show that their thinking was indeed <b>compatible with Islam.</b></p>
		  <p>By
		    the time of Al-Ghazali there was <b>considerable suspicion</b> about
		    the work of the Greek philosophers and consequently the work of al-Farabi
		    and Avicenna was somewhat <b>discredited</b>. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h3>Abu-Hamid Al-Ghazali (1058-1111)</h3>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Early life</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Al-Ghazali was <b>born in Tus</b>, near Meshed in North East Iran
		    in 1058CE. He began his education in Tus, however his father died while he
		    and his brother Ahmad were still boys. His father had left money with a <b>Sufi
	      friend</b> to provide for the education of his sons.</p>
		  <p>In 1074 Al-Ghazali
		      travelled to Gurgan on the Caspian sea to continue his education.
		    Tradition tells that he was robbed along the way, losing all his money
		    and books. This experience prompted him to commit to memory all that he
		    had learned. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Al-Juwayyi</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> In 1077 he went to the prestigious <b>Nizamiyya
		      college</b> to study under the esteemed scholar <b>Al-Juwayyi</b>.
		      His primary studies were in jurisprudence as well as Ash'arite
		      theology. It is likely that he was also encouraged to read the <b>works
		      of philosophers</b> such as Al-Fabari and Avicenna although he would
		      have had to have done this privately because Hellenism was considered
		      as a threat to Islam and it was not considered wise for a Muslim student
		      to study Greek philosophy. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Teaching reputation</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Near the end of his studies in 1085 Al-Ghazali began to teach and developed
		    a reputation as a <b>promising scholar</b>. After the death of
		    al-Juwayyi in August of 1085, Al-Ghazali went to the court of he great Vizier
		    Nizam-al-mulk. He remained there until 1091 when he was appointed <b>Professor
		    at the Nizamiyya college in Baghdad</b>, one of the most prestigious
	      positions in the Sunni Islamic world.</p>
		  <p>Four years later, in 1095, Al-Ghazali <b>abandoned his professorship</b> in
    Baghdad after suffering what may have been a breakdown or some serious psychological
    disturbance. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Left Baghdad</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>He experienced a <b>period of scepticism</b> and left Baghdad in
		    November of 1095 saying that he was going to make the pilgrimage to Makkah.
		    Instead he went to Damascus and began to live the <b>life of a Sufi </b>for
		    some months. He then completed the pilgrimage before returning to Baghdad
	      in June 1097. He then returned to Tus, his home town.</p>
		  <p>In Tus he established
		    a <b>community (khanqah)</b> where young men
  came and joined him in the Sufi life. While some suggested that Al-Ghazali's
  embracing of Sufism had political motivation, it nevertheless appears to have
  been a genuine conversion. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Nishapur</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Near the end of 1105CE Al-Ghazali responded to the requests of some
		    influential Muslims to take up the <b>professorship at the Nizamiyya
		    college in Nishapu</b>r. This urging seems to have been in the light
		    of a belief that at the beginning of each century, Allah would send
		    a "Mujaddid" (renewer
		    of the religion). With the sixth century of the Islamic calendar
	      beginning on September 2 nd 1106, Al-Ghazali was acclaimed as the <b>"Mujaddid".</b></p>
		  <p>He
		    began his teaching at Nishapur in mid 1106 and remained there until
		    1109 when he retired to Tus. He died on December 18 th 1111. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h3>Al-Ghazali's Writings</h3>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Profilic writer</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Although he was clearly a prolific writer, there is considerable dispute
		    about the authenticity of many works attributed to Al-Ghazali. In total
		    there are over <b>70 extant works</b> attributed to Al-Ghazali,
	      however, the <b>authenticity of at least half of them is questioned</b>.</p>
		  <p>Many
		    of the disputed works are considered to be the writings of Sufi authors
		    attempting to gain kudos by attributing their work to Al-Ghazali.
		    Many of the suspect works contain ideas which are clearly at odds with
		    the principal ideas found in Al-Ghazali's teaching.</p>
		  Of the undisputed works of Al-Ghazali<b>, eight works</b> in particular
stand out as his most <b>significant contribution</b> to Islamic thought.
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>The Ihya</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> <b>Ihya' `ulum ad-din (The Revival of the
		      Religious Sciences) </b>known simply as the Ihya is his most impressive
		      and influential work. It is a large collection of over <b>40 substantial
		      volume</b>s. The main aim of this Ihya was to show how careful observance
		      of the duties imposed by the Shari'ah law was the basis of an authentic
		      Sufi life.</p>
		  A second work also deals with Sufism and focuses particularly <b>on
		  Al-Ghazali's own Sufi practices</b>. This work is called Bidayat
		  al-idaya (The Beginning of Guidance) and is known simply at <b>the Bidayat</b>. 
		  </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Works on Philosophy</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>l-Ghazali produced <b>five significant works</b> dealing with
		  the field of philosophy. The most important of these was Masqasid al-falasifa
		  (The Aims of the Philosophers). Known simply as <b>the Masqasid</b>,
		  this work is regarded as an outstanding account of the work of the great
		  Islamic philosophers al-Farabi and Avicenna and their use of Aristotelian
		  and Neoplatonic philosophies. This work is regularly used as an introduction
		  to philosophical thought and due to its clarity and precision it has been
		  regarded as a clearer explanation of philosophy than the work of the original
		  philosophers.		  </p>
		  <p> A <b>critique of the metaphysical views</b> of some philosophers
  is found in the work Tahafut al-falasifa (The inconsistency of the Philosophers)
  known simply as <b>the Tahafut</b>.</p>
<p> Another important work of Al-Ghazali's is Al-Iqtisad fi-l-I'tiqad
  (The Just Mean in Belief) which made effective use of <b>Aristotelian
  syllogism</b> in explaining Islamic belief. It is known simply as <b>the
  Iqtisad</b>.</p>
<p> A further work in the area of philosophy focused on the ethical work of Muslim
  philosopher <b>ar-Raghib al-Isfahani</b>. This work Mizan al-`amal
  (The Criterion of Action) is known simply as <b>the Mizan</b>.</p>
<p> The final significant philosophical work focuses on the principles of <b>jurisprudence</b>.
  It is called Al-Mustasfa (The Pure Teaching) and is otherwise known as <b>the
  Mustasfa</b>.</p>
The last of the significant works of Al-Ghazali is called Al-Munqidh min ad-dalal
(The Deliverer from Error). Known simply as <b>the Munqidh</b> it is
effectively an exercise in <b>apologetics</b> defending and explaining
the changes in direction taken by Al-Ghazali in the course of his life. Its importance
lies in the amount of <b>biographical information</b> it provides as
well as in its critique of the extremes of Ash'arite theology.
		</div>
		</div>
		<h3>The Significance of Al-Ghazali's Life and Work</h3>
		 <div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Proof of Islam</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>Al-Ghazali's is widely known among Muslims as "The Proof of Islam",
		    a name which recognises his <b>significance in the Muslim world</b>.
		    He is recognised for his synthesis of <b>theology, philosophy, law and
	      mysticism.</b></p>
		  <p>Many modern scholars regard Al-Ghazali as <b>the
		    most important teacher in the history of Islam</b>, however this is
		    a modern trend and Al-Ghazali often did not enjoy such praise among
		    his contemporaries. His style of writing is particularly attractive to
		    modern learning, however, it was less attractive at his own time.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Major strands of Islam</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>l-Ghazali's analysis of Islamic thought included
		    substantial work on the four major paths or strands of Islam that were
		    evident in society at the time. These were <b>Ash'arite theology</b> which represented
		  the mainstream Sunni belief structure<b>, Isma'ilite theology</b> which
		  represented the smaller Shi'a group, the mystical movement of <b>Sufism</b> and <b>Kalam
		  theology</b> which was based on the insights of Greek philosophy.		  </p>
		  <p> He critiqued elements of all these paths or strands and as a consequence
  met with opposition and criticism from virtually all fronts.</p>
His critique of Ash'arite theology was based on the making of assumptions
or presuppositions which had no rational basis. 
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Ash'arite theology</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>He challenged the notion that the Qur'an was <b>uncreated</b> and
		    therefore the very <b>speech of Allah</b>. He questioned the understanding
		    of <b>anthropomorphic images</b> in the Qur'an and the
		    idea that <b>eschatological images</b> should be accepted at face value
	      rather than being regarded as <b>metaphors</b>.</p>
		  <p>Al-Ghazali also
		      challenged an understanding of <b>free will</b> which
    taught that Allah creates the acts of the individuals who simply acquire
		      them. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Isma'ilite theology</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>He critiqued aspects of Isma'ilite theology, in
		    particular the <b>relationship
            of knowledge</b> to the <b>teaching of the infallible Imam</b>.
            The Isma'ilites held that all knowledge on any point must come
          from the teaching of the infallible Imam.</p>

          <p>Al-Ghazali found himself
            drawn to <b>Sufi mysticism</b> because he
  believed that there was a limit to the knowledge that could be gained through
  rational means and that higher learning could only be achieved through <b>mystical
  disciplines</b>. While he embraced the Sufi way of life, he remained critical
  of some Sufi practices which disregarded the obligations of Shari'ah
  law. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Muslim philosophy</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>The work of the Greek philosophers <b>Aristotle and Plato</b> and
		    the writings of Muslim philosophers such as <b>al-Farabi and Avicenna</b> held
		    a great deal of interest for Al-Ghazali. On one hand he could see great potential
		    for the use of philosophical thought to provide <b>insight</b> into
		    and <b>explanation</b> of Muslim ideas. On the other hand, he
		    was wary about aspects of philosophy which were not in harmony with Muslim
	      beliefs.</p>
		  <p>His concerns were mostly in the area of metaphysics where he identified
		      twenty points of <b>conflict between metaphysics and the beliefs of Islam</b>.
		      Three key concepts underpinned these twenty concerns. The first
		      was that there was <b>no resurrection for the body</b> and
		      that resurrection was a spiritual reality only. Secondly that the <b>knowledge of Allah
		      is limited to universal aspects</b> and that Allah does not have
		      knowledge of particulars. Thirdly that the <b>world had existed for all time</b> and
		      was therefore not created. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Use of philosophy</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>l-Ghazali's study of philosophy led him to find
		    considerable value in the use of <b>Aristotelian syllogisms</b> which he frequently
		  used in explaining Muslim ideas.		  </p>
		  <p> The capacity of Al-Ghazali to be <b>at once critical and supportive</b> of
  ways of thinking was one of his greatest attributes. Rather than a wholesale
  rejection of an approach which was flawed, he was able to critique the areas
  of concern and adopt aspect which had value. This approach was in stark contrast
  to the tendency to take up one position and vigorously defend it against all
  others which prevailed at the time.</p>
Al-Ghazali's <b>measured use of different schools of thought</b> allowed
him to avoid the type of partisan conflict that accompanied much of the scholarly
development of Islam at the time. </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Synthesis of ideas</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> An additional element of Al-Ghazali's work, arising
		    from this approach, was his ability to synthesise the ideas of the <b>main
		    strands of Islamic thought</b>. This provided considerable impetus
		    in allowing the traditions of Islam to develop with <b>clarity and
		    relative harmony</b> which may not have been possible otherwise. Through
		    Al-Ghazali's contribution, Islam has developed a maturity that allows
		    it to <b>accept the best from its diverse strands</b> rather
		    than seeking to annihilate the other through religious and political
		    rivalry.</p>
