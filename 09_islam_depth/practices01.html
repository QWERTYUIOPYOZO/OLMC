		<h2>One significant practice in Islam - Hajj</h2>
		<h3>The five pillars</h3>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>arkan al-islam</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Within Islam, the practice of the faith is supported by five pillars.
		    These pillars, known as <b>arkan al-islam (the pillars of Islam)</b> are
		    activities and beliefs which are regarded as <b>foundational for all
		    who follow Islam</b>. Each of the pillars requires both <b>an
		    internal or spiritual commitment</b> together with an <b>outward
	      action or sign</b>.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h3>Hajj</h3>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>pilgrimage to Makkah</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The fifth pillar of Islam is the <b>pilgrimage or "hajj".</b> Every
		    devout Muslim male will desire to make the pilgrimage to Makkah at
		    least <b>once
		    in their lifetime</b>. For those who live nearby it may be possible
		    to make the pilgrimage on a number of occasions. However, for most
		    Muslims it is a once in a lifetime experience and some need to save for
	      most of their lives in order to perform the hajj.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>purpose of Hajj</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The word "hajj" means to embark on a <b>journey with
		      a purpose</b>. The purpose is essentially to <b>visit the Ka'bah
		      in Makkah</b> and <b>worship on Mount Arafat</b>. The
	      pilgrimage takes place during the twelfth month of the Muslim calendar "Dhul-Hijjah".</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>challenge of organisation</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The <b>organisation of the hajj</b> is an enormous challenge
		    both for the individuals undertaking the pilgrimage and for those
		    in Saudi Arabia responsible for organising it. The individual not only
		    needs to <b>provide
		    for their own needs</b> on the pilgrimage but they also need to provide
	      for the <b>needs of their family while they are away</b>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>hajj guides</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> For the organisers in Saudi Arabia the hajj is an enormous exercise in
		    logistics. Over a million people gather annually in Saudi Arabia
		    for the hajj. Those undertaking the hajj are <b>organised into groups</b> under
		    the guidance of an <b>experienced hajj guide</b> who is able
	      to <b>ensure that the proper protocols are followed.</b></p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>community and goodwill</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Despite the degree of organisation and the expertise of the hajj leaders,
		    there is an inevitable element of chaos with such a large gathering. Yet
		    despite the heat, the logistical difficulties and enormous crowd there
		    is a <b>great
sense of community and goodwill</b> among the pilgrims which readily outweighs
the difficulties encountered.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>attitude of pilgrims</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The hajj is an event for <b>Muslims only,</b> tourists are
		    not allowed to attend. It is expected that the pilgrims who attend
		    will be people with the <b>maturity and soundness of mind</b> to
		    understand the significance of what they are undertaking. <b>A</b><b>certain
		    degree of physical fitness is expected</b> in order to manage the
	      physical demands of the pilgrimage.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>intention known as "niyyah"</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Some Muslims are <b>not able to undertake the pilgrimage</b> themselves
due to <b>poor health, a lack of financial means or unexpected and unavoidable
circumstances</b>. In these cases Muslims believe that the <b>intention
will suffice</b>. This intention, known as <b>"niyyah"</b> is
an important element. Muslims believe that <b>Allah judges them on their
intentions providing that their efforts are sincere</b>. Therefore someone
who is genuinely unable to perform the hajj need not feel that they are failing
in their religious duty.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>symbolic pilgrimage</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> In some instances, Muslims who are <b>not able to perform the hajj</b> seek
		    to <b>join the pilgrims in a symbolic way</b> by <b>paying
		    for someone</b> else to attend in their place or <b>giving to
		    charity</b> the money that they have saved for the hajj. In the case
		    of paying for someone else to attend in their place there is a restriction
	      that this person must already have performed the hajj on their own
	      behalf.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>prescribed rituals</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>There are various <b>prescribed aspects</b> undertaken by pilgrims
performing the hajj. The preparation phase of the hajj takes place <b>outside
of Makkah</b>. This preparatory stage involves placing themselves in an <b>appropriate
disposition or attitude</b>. This involves a deliberate and <b>conscious
striving towards a state of purity</b>. This attitude is known as <b>"ihram".</b> As
a sign of their preparedness all <b>normal clothing is replaced</b> by
a simple ensemble of two white cloths, one worn around the waist, the other draped
over the left shoulder. Women wear a plain garment covering all but their hands,
their feet and their face.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>arrival in Makkah</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> As the <b>pilgrim arrives in Makkah</b> they begin to repeatedly
		    pray the <b>prayer known as "talbiyah"</b> which
		    is in the form of a response to the call to perform the hajj. Immediately
		    upon arriving in Makkah <b>pilgrims go to the Ka'bah and encircle
	      it seven times</b>. This encircling is known as <b>"tawaf".</b></p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>procession</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The next event to follow is the <b>procession known as the "sa'y".</b> This
procession takes place between Safa and Marwah and is <b>completed seven
times</b>. This procession is based on the Qu'ranic tradition of Hajar's
search for water in the desert.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>journey to Mina</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The next part of the hajj involves a journey to Mina which is undertaken
		    on the 8 th day of the month of Dhul-Hijjah. In Mina<b> pebbles are
		    hurled a pillars</b> to symbolise the <b>rejection of the devil</b> and
	      all works of evil.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Mount Arafat</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>After camping in Mina the journey continues to <b>Mount</b><b> Arafat</b>.
		    On the plain of Arafat people <b>stand from midday until sunset in
		    a state of meditation</b> This is known as the <b>"wuquf" or
		    the standing before Allah</b>. The pilgrims then climb Mount Arafat
		    where a sermon is preached.</p>
		  <p>The pilgrimage continues, however, to
		      Mina via Muzdalifah where <b>night prayer</b> is held together
		      with a <b>ritual
		      stoning of the devil</b>. On the morning of 10 Dhul-Hijjah the pilgrims
		      stand before dawn in a brief<b> repetition of the "wuquf"</b> before
		      moving on towards Mina as the sun begins to rise. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>offering of sacrifice</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>In Mina the pilgrims camp for <b>three days</b> while offering
		    the required <b>sacrifice of an animal for Id-ul-Adha</b>. After
		    this, men have their <b>heads shaved</b> and women are required
	      to cut their hair by at least 2.5 cm.</p>
		  <p>The hajj then <b>returns to Makkah</b> for another <b>encircling
    of the Ka'bah as the final event of the pilgrimage</b>. Having
    completed the hajj Muslims are entitled to take the name <b>Hajji or Hajjah</b>. </p>
