                                           <li> The first principle is the notion
                                             of trusteeship "khalifa" </li>
                                           <li> Allah has placed creation in
                                             the trust of human beings. </li>
                                           <li> " The world is green and
                                             beautiful, and Allah has appointed
                                             you his guardian over it" (Hadith)
                                             This guardianship </li>
                                           <li> Kahlifa involves the appropriate
                                             use of the world's resources for
                                             the needs of humankind but in a
                                             way which nurtures and sustains
                                             the environment </li>
                                           <li> The environment is seen not as

                                             as their responsibility to care
                                             for and nurture </li>
                                           <li> Second principle is "tawhid" </li>
                                           <li> Tawhid refers to the unity and
                                             absolute oneness of Allah </li>
                                           <li> By extension it includes the
                                             unity and oneness of that which
                                             is created by Allah The unity of
                                             Allah is clearly reflected in the
                                             integrity of the created world </li>
                                           <li> The principle of "tawhid" demands
                                             that the integrity of the created
                                             world is maintained and respected </li>

                                           <li> This includes a judgement concerning
                                             how they have acted in relation

                                               Allah on the way they carried
                                             our their responsibilities towards

                                             of Islam and of other legitimate

                                             both a sign and a symptom of an

                                             to selfishly satisfy their own wants
                                             with little or no regard for others </li>

                                           <li> Islam arose in the harsh desert
                                             environment of the Arabian peninsular </li>
                                           <li> Water was a cherished commodity </li>
                                           <li> Religious reflections of Islam
                                             often reflect on the element of
                                             water </li>
                                           <li> Muslim paradise images are of
                                             a desert oasis with abundant refreshing
                                             water </li>
                                           <li> Images of refreshing rain, rivers
                                             and fountains of flavoured water
                                             to drink </li>
                                           <li> The waters flow beneath and throughout
                                             the gardens of paradise providing
                                             coolness as well as lush greenery </li>
                                           <li> Water is seen as synonymous with
                                             life </li>
                                           <li> It is the source of all life
                                             and is regarded as a gift of Allah </li>
                                           <li> Musims are reminded that water
                                             is a gift and to be preserved and
                                             used with care </li>
                                           <li> The concern for a sustainable
                                             water supply resulted in the determination
                                             of forbidden (haraam) areas near
                                             water supplies </li>
                                           <li> Prohibited to use water excessively
                                             or wastefully </li>
                                           <li> Water is a requirement of Muslim
                                             prayer </li>
                                           <li> The ritual washing known as "wudu" is
                                             required for purification before
                                             each of the obligatory five times
                                             of daily prayer </li>
                                           <li> Muhammad forbade Muslims to wash
                                             more than three times during the
                                             ritual washing as this would be
                                             wasteful. </li>
                                           <li> Muslims regard water as one of
                                             the things that should be freely
                                             available to all Not permitted to
                                             withhold water from one who needs
                                             it </li>
                                           <li> All people have the right to
                                             quench their thirst, to water their
                                             animals and to irrigate their crops </li>
                                           <li> In today's world many people
                                             lack the basic necessity of clean
                                             drinking water </li>
                                           <li> It is difficult for Muslims to
                                             reconcile their teaching on the
                                             fundamental rights to water when
                                             the reality of pollution and poverty
                                             means that millions of people are
                                             denied such rights </li>
                                           <li> Justice intersects with concerns
                                             for the environment </li>
                                           <li> Not possible to address concerns
                                             for the environment without also
                                             addressing concerns about issues
                                             of justice, the distribution of
                                             wealth and the ownership and use
                                             of the world's resources </li>
                                           <li> Islamic ethical teaching recognises
                                             that matters such as justice and
                                             the environment are integrally connected </li>
                                           <li> Also recognises that genuine
                                             progress will not be achieved without
                                             the element of conversion of individuals
                                             and societies </li>
                                           <li>Not possible to develop
                                               a community based on justice and
                                               concern for the environment when
                                               individuals are selfishly pursuing
	                                       their own interests to the detriment
                                               of others and ultimately the whole
                                               of creation</li>
