		<h1>Content Description </h1>
		<h2>Islamic Teachings on Environmental Ethics</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Major Sources</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Teaching on the care of the environment is found within all the major
		    sources of Islam. Principally the <b>Qur'an</b> has a number of
		    specific references to ecology and also contains some important principles
		    which are able to be applied to the environment. The tradition of the Prophet
		    Muhammad <b>(Hadith)</b> has a number of other important statements.
		    Finally, <b>Shari'ah</b> law includes many teachings which
		    explain the application of Qur'anic principles to areas not specifically
	      addressed in the Qur'an.</p>
		  <p>Thus, collectively, the sources of authority
		      in Islam provide <b>clear teaching
    and direction</b> to Muslims in their relationship with the environment. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Modern Issues</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Environmental concerns are <b>substantially of a modern nature</b> and
		    in many cases relate to issues which are peculiar to an <b>industrialised
		    world</b>. Issues such as over population, global warming etc belong
		    to recent generations. It is unreasonable, therefore, to expect the sources
		    of an ancient religion to deal specifically with these modern issues. However,
		    Islamic scholars have found that the <b>principles of Muslim life</b> do
		    provide very clear guidance in relation to these issues. Therefore, while
		    some environmental issues are addressed in specific terms through Muslim
		    sources, other teachings are drawn from the application of fundamental
	      principles to modern concerns. </p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>Principles of Environmental Ethics</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Trusteeship</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The first principle which guides Islamic teaching on ecology is the
		    notion of trusteeship. The term <b>"khalifa"</b> means
		    trustee and guardian and it refers to the understanding that in creating
	      the world Allah has <b>placed creation in the trust of human beings</b>.</p>
		  <p>The
		    tradition of the Prophet Muhammad states "The world is green and beautiful,
  and Allah has appointed you his <b>guardian over it</b>" (Hadith).
  This guardianship "kahlifa" involves the appropriate use of the world's
  resources for the needs of humankind but in a way which nurtures and sustains
  the environment. The environment is seen not as the property of human beings
  but as their <b>responsibility to care for and nurture</b>. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Unity and integrity of creation</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Another principle is that of "tawhid". Tawhid refers principally
		    to the <b>unity and absolute oneness of Allah</b> yet by extension
		    it includes the unity and oneness of that which is created by Allah. The
		    unity of Allah is clearly reflected in the <b>integrity of the created
		    world</b> and the principle of "tawhid" demands that the
	      integrity of the created world is maintained and respected. </p>
		  </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Akrah</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>A third principle is that of <b>accountability</b> "akrah".
Muslims understand that they will be judged by Allah for the way they have undertaken
their responsibilities. This will include a judgement concerning how they have
acted <b>in relation to the environment</b>. Muslims believe that they
will be questioned by Allah on the way they carried our their responsibilities
towards all aspects of creation.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>The Qur'an and the Environment</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Custodians</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> "It is <b>He that has made you custodians</b>, inheritors
		    of the earth" (surah 6:165). This surah enunciates the principles
		    of human beings as "khalifa" or custodians of the earth. It is
		    one of the important texts which clearly state the relationship between
		    humankind and the rest of creation. It also highlights that this <b>relationship
		    of responsibility</b> has been ordained by Allah or in other word
	      is the will of Allah.</p>
		  </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Subjected to humankind</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Another example setting out this relationship is found in surah 45:12-13
		    which speaks of all that is the heavens and the earth being subjected to
		    humankind. While human beings have the <b>use of the resources of
		    the world</b>,
they do not have a right to <b>exploit or destroy</b> these resources.
Their use of the world's resources should be in keeping with the nurturing and
sustaining responsibilities of their guardianship.</p>
		  </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Diversity and balance in nature</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The Qur'an clearly conveys the important elements of the <b>diversity
		      and balance that exists in nature</b>: "And the earth-we
		      have spread it out wide, and placed on it mountains firm, and caused
		      life of every kind to grow on it in a balanced manner, and provided
		      means of livelihood for you as well as for all living beings whose sustenance
		      does not depend on you. " (surah15:19). Human beings have a <b>fundamental
		      responsibility</b> to use the world's resources in a way which does
		      not diminish the diversity of creation or threaten the balance
	      and harmony that exists.</p>
		  </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Human beings in relation to creation</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The degree of control that human beings can exercise over creation
		  is tempered by the Qur'an recognising that <b>human beings are
		  only one aspect of the wonder of creation</b>. "Greater indeed
		  than the creation of man is the creation of the heavens and the earth." (surah
		  40:57). This text clearly speaks against the possibility of reckless
		  or complete domination of the natural world for the benefit of human
		  beings. In fact it has been used to show that an <b>anthropocentric
		  view of creation</b> is <b>incompatible
		  with the teaching of the Qur'an</b>.		  </p>
		  <p> The environment is depicted in the Qur'an as <b>praising and exalting
    Allah</b>. "Have you not seen that unto Allah pays adoration whosoever
    is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth, and the sun, and the moon,
    and the stars, and the hills, and the trees, and the beasts, and many of
    mankind ..." (surah 22:18).</p>
Another example from the Qur'an conveying a similar idea is found in surah 17:44 "The
seven heavens and the earth and all therein praise him and there is not a thing
but hymns his praise. See! He is ever clement, forgiving." 
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Relationship of creation and creator</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Texts such as these alert the Muslim to the relationship between Allah
		    and the environment. It is <b>created by Allah</b> and <b>reflects
		    Allah's greatness</b>. Thus there is a <b>sacredness</b> in
		    the environment which stems from its relationship with Allah. To
		    fail to honour this sacredness is to deny the manner of creation
	      and the glory of Allah as creator.</p>
		  Many of the other texts in the Qur'an elaborate the theme of <b>Allah
		  as the creator</b> and convey aspects of the principle of <b>human
		  beings as the guardians of creation</b>. Some of these texts focus on
		  specific elements such as the rain (surah 21:30) and vegetation (surah 56:63).
		  Scholars have noted that there are over 700 occasions where the Qur'an includes
		  some specific reflection on nature and the environment. 
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Environmental Hadiths</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Concern for environment</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The tradition of the Prophet Muhammad shows clearly that he held a
		    deep concern for the natural environment and encouraged Muslims to <b>treat
		    it with respect</b> and to <b>nurture it with care</b> and
		    concern for the future.</p>
		  <p>The most well known of the Hadiths relating
		    to the environment states "the earth is green and beautiful and Allah
		    has appointed you his stewards over it". This tradition simply <b>reiterates
		    the teaching of the Qur'an </b>that human beings have been given
		    the responsibility of guardianship over the natural environment.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Sacredness</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> A further example from the tradition of the Prophet Muhammad says "the
		    whole earth has been created a place of worship, pure and clean".
		    In this Hadith, there is an <b>affirmation of the sacredness of creation</b> and
		    an implicit <b>warning against its defilement</b>. By acknowledging
		    that the earth is a place of worship, the Prophet Muhammad is recognising
		    it as a sacred entity. To act in a way that is harmful to the environment
		    is akin to defiling a place of worship which would be a serious affront
	      to Allah and to all Muslims.</p>
		  </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Acts of love</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> A third example shows the Prophet Muhammad teaching that the planting
		    of a tree or the sowing of a field which provides for the needs of
		    people and of animals is <b>an act of love</b>. This Hadith provides
		    an example of the expectation that Muslims would work with the environment
		    in a <b>caring and nurturing way</b>. The environment is intended
		    to provide for the <b>needs of human beings</b> and human beings
		    are meant to work with the environment to ensure its <b>sustainability</b>. "If
		    a Muslim plants a tree or sow and field and humans and beasts and
	      birds eat from it, all of it is love on his part" (Hadith).</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>The Environment and Islamic Law</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Shari'ah</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> One of the functions of Islamic law "Shari'ah" is to
		    apply the principles enunciated in the Qur'an to specific circumstances
		    and situations which are <b>not specifically addressed in the Qur'an</b>.
		    Many environmental concerns are <b>modern issues</b> of a post
		    industrialised world and were not envisaged at the time of the revelation
		    of the Qur'an. Accordingly, the application of Shari'ah law
	      is extremely relevant and important in Muslim teaching on the environment.</p>
		  </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Hunting</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Muslim teaching prevents hunting other than to provide for the <b>needs
		      of the community</b> and there are laws providing for the most <b>humane
		      way of killing</b> animals where it is necessary. There are also
		      teachings about the <b>welfare of animals</b> which relate
		      to the keeping of animals in confinement. Animals should not be
		      tied up or kept in unsuitably small spaces. They must also be kept in
	      clean and sanitary surroundings.</p>
		  </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Animal experiments</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The use of animals for scientific experiments is a matter of some concern
		    and debate. In general, Islamic teaching would <b>oppose experimentation
		    on animals</b> other than those that seek to bring genuinely needed
		    benefits to humanity and only then after careful consideration of
		    all alternatives. <b>Testing
	      of cosmetic products</b> on animals is not condoned.</p>
		  </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Many situations</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>There are many situations that have been addressed in the development
		    of Shari'ah laws. These include laws governing the growth and size
		    of <b>cities</b>, appropriate uses for <b>land</b>, prohibitions
		    against <b>overstocking</b> grazing land, the protection of <b>forests</b> and <b>wildlife</b> and
	      many other issues.</p>
		  <p>One of the most interesting elements is the laws
		    that state that forest land, pasture land and wildlife cannot be
		    privately owned. Shari'ah
		    law dictates that these elements are to be owned by the state and
		    managed for the <b>good of the whole community</b>. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Modern issues</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Much of the body of Shari'ah law was developed centuries ago and
		    as such <b>do not fully address</b> the concerns of the <b>modern
		    environmental crisis</b>. Some scholars believe that Islam has been
		    slow to respond to contemporary environmental issues because its
		    laws are yet to be brought to bear on such issues as global warming, greenhouse
	      gas emissions, acid rain etc.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>Religion and Ecology</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Materialism and secularism</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> For Muslims, the current extremes in <b>environmental degradation </b><b>parallel </b>the
		    worst excesses of <b>materialism and secularism</b>. They show
		    a contempt for the environment which is in effect a contempt for
		    the creator and a contempt for the natural order.</p>
		  <p>In seeking <b>self fulfillment</b>,
		      humankind has dramatically moved away from the type of community
		    and the type of values which are at the heart of Islam and of other legitimate
		    religious faiths. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Ecological crisis</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The ecological crisis is seen as both a <b>sign and a symptom</b> of
		    an attitude where the individual seeks to selfishly <b>satisfy their
		    own wants</b> with little or no regard for others. Such an attitude
		    is ultimately self destructive as it results in the <b>exploitation</b> of
		    the world's resources, the exploitation of other people and the loss <b>of
	      human dignity</b> and true human values.</p>
		  <p>Muslims believe that the solution
		      to the modern environmental crisis will be found only in a radical <b>transformation
		      of values</b> and ultimately <b>submission
    to the will of Allah</b>. It is not sufficient to simply speak of ecological
    measures which superficially address the symptoms without also addressing
    the fundamental causes of the crisis. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Water - A Key Concern</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Desert environment</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Given that Islam arose in the harsh desert environment of the Arabian
		    peninsular, it is not surprising that water was a <b>cherished commodity</b> and
		    that the religious reflections of Islam often reflect on the element
		    of water.</p>
		  <p>Muslim visions of <b>paradise</b> provide images of a
		      desert oasis with <b>abundant refreshing water</b>. There are
		      images of refreshing rain, rivers and fountains of flavoured water to
		      drink. The waters flow beneath and throughout the gardens of paradise
		      providing coolness as well as lush greenery. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Gift of Allah</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>  Water is seen as <b>synonymous with life</b>, it is the source
		    of all life and is regarded as a gift of Allah. In the context of reminding
		    humankind that they are the guardians of creation they are reminded that
	      water is a gift and to be <b>preserved and used with care</b>.</p>
		  In the time of the Prophet Muhammad, the concern for a sustainable
		  water supply resulted in the determination of forbidden (haraam) areas near
		  water supplies. It was <b>prohibited to use water excessively or wastefully.</b> </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Ritual washing</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Water is a requirement of Muslim prayer. The ritual washing known as "wudu" is
		    required for <b>purification</b> before each of the obligatory
		    five times of <b>daily prayer</b>. In this context, the Prophet
		    Muhammad forbade Muslims to wash more than three times during the
	      ritual washing as this would be wasteful.</p>
		  <p>Muslims regard water as one of
		    the things that <b>should be freely available to all </b>and
		    are not permitted to withhold water from one who needs it. According
		    the Shari'ah law,
		    all people have the right to quench their thirst, to water their
		    animals and to irrigate their crops.</p>
		  </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Water crisis</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The preciousness of water is all the more keenly felt in today's
		    world where so many people lack the <b>basic necessity of clean drinking water</b>.
		    It is difficult for Muslims to reconcile their teaching on the fundamental
		    rights to water when the reality of pollution and poverty means that millions
	      of people are <b>denied such rights</b>.</p>
		  <p>In this regard the area
		    of <b>justice intersects with concerns for the environment</b>.
  It is not possible to address concerns for the environment without also addressing
  concerns about issues of justice, the distribution of wealth and the ownership
  and use of the world's resources.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Connections</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Islamic ethical teaching recognises that matters such as justice and
		    the environment are <b>integrally connected</b>. It also recognises
		    that genuine progress will not be achieved without the element of <b>conversion
		    of individuals and societies</b>. It is not possible to develop a
		    community based on justice and concern for the environment when individuals
		    are selfishly pursuing their own interests to the detriment of others
		    and ultimately the whole of creation.</p>
