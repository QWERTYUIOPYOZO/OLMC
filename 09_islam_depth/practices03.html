		<h2>The significance of the Hajj for the individual</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Pillars of Islam</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam <b>"arkan-al-islam".</b> It
		    is a requirement for all Muslim males to undertake the Hajj. Many women
	      as well will seek to fulfil the requirements of the Hajj.</p>
		  <p>The pillars of Islam
		      are considered as foundational as they guide the Muslim in the
		    way of <b>submission to the will of Allah</b> which
              is the essence of Islam. Given the foundational nature of the Hajj
              as one of the pillars of Islam, it is hard to overstate its significance
              for the individual Muslim. The devout Muslim will undertake the
		    Hajj in <b>obedience to the Qur'an</b> and in order to
		    more perfectly submit themselves to the will of Allah. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Submission</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Submission to Allah is the <b>essence of Islam</b> and undertaking
		    the Hajj is one of the important elements for Muslims to submit more
		    fully and more perfectly to Allah. For a Muslim to undertake the Hajj they
		    must carry out demanding preparations which involve practical elements
	      as well as preparing a proper inner disposition.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Practical concerns</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> In practical terms a Muslim must provide for their <b>own needs</b> during
		    the Hajj, such as the cost of their travel etc as well as providing
		    for the <b>needs of their family</b> while they are away. Thus
		    at a practical level there are considerable demands on the person undertaking
		    the Hajj. There are also the <b>physical demands</b> of the Hajj
	      itself which are challenging to all pilgrims.</p>
		  </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Spiritual preparation</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Apart from the practical and physical requirements, a devout Muslim
		    will also undergo an <b>inner or spiritual preparation</b> to ensure
		    the efficacy of the Hajj for to undertake the Hajj without the appropriate
		    attitude or disposition would be to render the experience useless in terms
		    of its <b>spiritual value</b>. Therefore the devout Muslim will
		    ensure that he or she is spiritually prepared for the Hajj before
	      undertaking the pilgrimage.</p>
		  <p>The magnitude of the preparation for the Hajj,
		      both practical and spiritual, are further elements highlighting
		    the significance of the Hajj for the individual Muslim. Given its demands,
		    it would not be possible for the undertaking of the Hajj to be other than
		    an event of <b>profound
		      significance</b> for the devout Muslim. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Personal commitment</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> A further element demonstrating the significance of the Hajj for the
		    individual is the element of <b>testing of personal resolve</b> and
		    commitment involved in undertaking the Hajj. Many of the elements
		    of the Hajj centre on the act of <b>rejection of the devil</b> and
		    remaining faithful in submission to Allah. In order to undertake the Hajj,
		    a Muslim would be required to overcome a number of challenges to their
		    resolve and commit themselves seriously to the task. In this sense they
		    are emulating the elements of the Hajj itself, overcoming the temptation
	      the devil and remaining steadfast in their <b>submission to Allah</b>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Community</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>A final element of significance for the individual Muslim is found
		    in their experience of the international <b>community of Islam</b> through
		    undertaking the Hajj. Islam is a religious tradition which is spread
		    widely throughout the world and Muslims are found in virtually every
		    region. In recent years the Hajj has attracted over two million Muslims
		    from countries <b>throughout
		    the world</b>.</p>
		  <p>Thus for the pilgrim undertaking the Hajj there is a
		      profound and overwhelming sense of the <b>diversity of Islam</b>,
		      yet at the same time, an experience of the <b>unity of the Muslim world</b> converging
		      on the holy city of Makkah for the Hajj. In Islam there is no distinction
		      between people and no place for racism or prejudice. In undertaking
		      the Hajj the Muslim pilgrim experiences these elements of Islam in a
		      profound and powerful way. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>The significance of the Hajj for the Muslim community</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Community significance</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> The significance of the Hajj for the Muslim community can be seen in
		    four elements. Firstly in the <b>public statement</b> it makes
		    about submission to Allah, secondly in the way it provides <b>inspiration</b> to
		    others, thirdly in its <b>edification</b> of the Muslim community
		    and finally in its <b>witness</b> to the principles of international
	      and multiracial harmony.</p>
		  Each year over two million pilgrims gather in Makkah to undertake the
		  Hajj. It is an event of epic proportions and receives considerable media
		  coverage throughout the world, including countries such as Australia with
		  relatively small Muslim communities. </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Public awareness</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Given the degree of <b>public consciousness</b> raised by the "spectacle" of
the Hajj, there is an important element of <b>witness to the principles</b> of
Islam which are expressed in undertaking the Hajj. Essentially the Hajj is an
expression of submission to Allah and when undertaken on such a large scale and
with such <b>widespread attention</b> it provides an important witness
to the essence of Islam.</p>
		  </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Inspiration</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The second element of the significance of the Hajj to the Muslim community
		    is found in the way it <b>inspires others</b>. While the Hajj is
		    essentially undertaken by individuals it <b>involves the community</b> in
		    many ways. The community is involved with the preparation of the pilgrims
		    before they leave, in supporting family member of the pilgrim while
		    they are undertaking the Hajj and often in having special times of prayer
	      and of course with the festival of Id-ul-Adha, the festival of sacrifice.</p>
		  <p>In
		      the midst of the <b>community support</b> for the pilgrims
		      and the accompanying festival and prayer there is a great <b>source of inspiration</b> to
    others in the community to commit themselves to undertake the Hajj. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Community building</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>Thirdly, there is an important element of community building that takes
		  place in association with the Hajj. This community building happens
		    both at an <b>international level</b> in and through the contact
		    with others during the Hajj and also at the <b>local level</b> through
		  the involvement of the local Muslim community with pilgrims who are
		    undertaking the Hajj.
		  </p>
		  <p> The connection of the community with a pilgrim undertaking the Hajj provides
  an additional element of <b>spiritual and community</b> focus during
  the time of the Hajj and provides a means to <b>strengthen and deepen
  community life.</b></p>
A fourth element of significance to the Muslim community is the witness to the <b>international
and interracial harmony</b> which is integral to the Hajj. Muslims gather
from all corners of the world to undertake the Hajj and in their coming together
they provide a powerful witness to both the <b>unity and diversity</b> of
the Muslim community throughout the world. </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Tolerance and respect</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The most significant element of this <b>witness to the diversity of
		    Islam</b> is the way in which all races and nationalities can come together
		    with tolerance and respect in a display of <b>racial harmony</b>.
		    In Islam there is no place for discrimination on the basis of race
	      and the Hajj provides a powerful witness to this fundamental element of Islam.</p>
		  <p>It
		      also shows the unifying power of Islam in being able to bring so
		    many people of so many ethnic backgrounds together in a <b>common act of submission
    to Allah.</b> </p>
