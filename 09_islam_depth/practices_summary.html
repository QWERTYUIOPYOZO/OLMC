								  		 <ul>
                                           <li> The practice of the faith is
                                             supported by five pillars. </li>
                                           <li> Arkan al-islam (the pillars of
                                             Islam) are activities and beliefs
                                             which are regarded as foundational
                                             for all who follow Islam. </li>
                                           <li> Each of the pillars requires
                                             both an internal or spiritual commitment
                                             together with an outward action
                                             or sign.</li>

								  		 <h2> Hajj</h2>
								  		 <ul>
                                           <li> The fifth pillar of Islam is
                                             the pilgrimage or "hajj". </li>
                                           <li> Every devout Muslim seeks to
                                             make the pilgrimage to Makkah at
                                             least once in their lifetime. </li>
                                           <li> The word "hajj" means
                                             to embark on a journey with a purpose. </li>
                                           <li> The purpose is to visit the Ka"bah
                                             in Makkah and worship on Mount Arafat. </li>
                                           <li> The pilgrimage takes place during
                                             the twelfth month of the Muslim
                                             calendar "Dhul-Hijjah". </li>
                                           <li> The individual not only needs
                                             to provide for their own needs on
                                             the pilgrimage but they also need
                                             to provide for the needs of their
                                             family while they are away. Over
                                             a million people gather annually
                                             in Saudi Arabia for the hajj. </li>
                                           <li> Those undertaking the hajj are
                                             organised into groups under the
                                             guidance of an experienced hajj
                                             guide who is able to ensure that
                                             the proper protocols are followed. </li>
                                           <li> The hajj is an event for Muslims
                                             only </li>
                                           <li> It is expected that the pilgrims
                                             who attend will be people with the
                                             maturity and soundness of mind to
                                             understand the significance of what
                                             they are undertaking. </li>
                                           <li> A certain degree of physical
                                             fitness is expected in order to
                                             manage the physical demands of the
                                             pilgrimage. </li>
                                           <li> Some Muslims are not able to
                                             undertake the pilgrimage themselves
                                             due to poor health, a lack of financial
                                             means or unexpected and unavoidable
                                             circumstances. In these cases Muslims
                                             believe that the intention will
                                             suffice. </li>
                                           <li> This intention is as "niyyah" </li>
                                           <li> Muslims believe that Allah judges
                                             them on their intentions providing
                                             that their efforts are sincere. </li>
                                           <li> In some instances, Muslims who
                                             are not able to perform the hajj
                                             seek to join the pilgrims in a symbolic
                                             way by paying for someone else to
                                             attend in their place or giving
                                             to charity the money that they have
                                             saved for the hajj </li>
                                           <li> There are various prescribed
                                             aspects undertaken by pilgrims performing
                                             the hajj. The preparation phase
                                             of the hajj takes place outside
                                             of Makkah. </li>
                                           <li> This preparatory stage involves
                                             placing themselves in an appropriate
                                             disposition or attitude. </li>
                                           <li> This involves a deliberate and
                                             conscious striving towards a state
                                             of purity. </li>
                                           <li> This attitude is known as "ihram". </li>
                                           <li> As a sign of their preparedness
                                             all normal clothing is replaced
                                             by a simple ensemble of two white
                                             cloths, one worn around the waist,
                                             the other draped over the left shoulder. </li>
                                           <li> Women wear a plain garment covering
                                             all but their hands, their feet
                                             and their face. </li>
                                           <li> As the pilgrim arrives in Makkah
                                             they begin to repeatedly pray the
                                             prayer known as "talbiyah" </li>
                                           <li> Immediately upon arriving in
                                             Makkah pilgrims go to the Ka"bah
                                             and encircle it seven times. </li>
                                           <li> This encircling is known as "tawaf". </li>
                                           <li> The next event to follow is the
                                             procession known as the "sa"y". </li>
                                           <li> This procession takes place between
                                             Safa and Marwah and is completed
                                             seven times. </li>
                                           <li> This procession is based on the
                                             Qu"ranic tradition of Hajar"s
                                             search for water in the desert. </li>
                                           <li> The next part of the hajj involves
                                             a journey to Mina. </li>
                                           <li> In Mina pebbles are hurled a
                                             pillars to symbolise the rejection
                                             of the devil </li>
                                           <li> After camping in Mina the journey
                                             continues to Mount Arafat. </li>
                                           <li> On the plain of Arafat people
                                             stand from midday until sunset in
                                             a state of meditation </li>
                                           <li> This is known as the "wuquf" or
                                             the standing before Allah. </li>
                                           <li> The pilgrims then climb Mount
                                             Arafat where a sermon is preached. </li>
                                           <li> The pilgrimage continues to Mina
                                             via Muzdalifah where night prayer
                                             is held </li>
                                           <li> On the morning of 10 Dhul-Hijjah
                                             the pilgrims stand before dawn in
                                             a brief repetition of the "wuquf" before
                                             moving on towards Mina as the sun
                                             begins to rise. </li>
                                           <li> In Mina the pilgrims camp for
                                             three days while offering the required
                                             sacrifice of an animal for Id-ul-Adha. </li>
                                           <li> After this, men have their heads
                                             shaved and women are required to
                                             cut their hair by at least 2.5 cm. </li>
                                           <li> The hajj then returns to Makkah
                                             for another encircling of the Ka"bah
                                             as the final event of the pilgrimage.                                             </li>
