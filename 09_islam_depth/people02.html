		<h1>Content Description </h1>
		<h2> The Impact of Al-Ghazali on Islam</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Synthesis of ideas</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>The impact of Al-Ghazali on the development of Islam can be seen in
		  his accomplished synthesis of the areas <b>of theology, philosophy,
		  law and mysticism</b>. He has made significant contributions to each
		  of these disciplines yet his most profound impact has been his ability
		  to bring out the <b>best from all these disciplines</b> and strands
		  of Islam in a way that provided <b>strength and maturity to Islamic
		  thought</b>.		  </p>
		  <p> His <b>prolific writing</b> and <b>highly regarded teaching</b> has
  ensured that he has had considerable impact on the religion of Islam. His impact,
  while significant during his own time has continued to grow over the centuries
  and he is now regarded by many modern scholars as the <b>greatest teacher
  in the history of Islam</b>.</p>
Al-Ghazali's reputation and contribution to Islam is summed up in the title
by which he is widely known. He is known as <b>"the Proof of Islam",</b> a
title which recognises the <b>extent and quality of his teaching</b>. 
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Critique of Theology</h2>
		
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Al-Ghazali undertook critiques of all the <b>main ideas and schools
		      of thought</b> at the time. These critiques included criticisms
		      of some elements of Ash'arite as well as Isma'ilite theology
	      which were the basis of the Sunni and Shi'a strands respectively.</p>
		  His criticisms resulted in Al-Ghazali being <b>opposed by the various
		  groups</b> of Islam. However, it also allowed him to develop his critical <b>synthesis
		  of ideas</b> which would become one of his most significant contributions
		  to Islam. </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Ash'arite theology</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>His critique of Ash'arite theology, principally contained
		    in <b>"the
		  Munqidh"</b> was based on the making of assumptions or presuppositions
		  which had <b>no rational basis</b>. He challenged the notion that
		  the Qur'an was uncreated and therefore the very speech of Allah. He
		  questioned the understanding of anthropomorphic images in the Qur'an
		  and the idea that eschatological images should be accepted at face
		  value rather than being regarded as metaphors. Al-Ghazali also challenged
		  an understanding of free will which taught that Allah creates the acts
		  of the individuals who simply acquire them.</p>
		  <p>He criticised <b>Isma'ilite
		    thelogy</b>, in particular the relationship
  of knowledge to the teaching of the infallible Imam. The Isma'ilites held
  that all knowledge on any point must come from the teaching of the <b>infallible
  Imam</b>. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Critique of Philosophy</h2>
		<p>The second element of Al-Ghazali's work was his writings on the influential philosophers of his time</p>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Aristotle and Plato</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> The work of the Greek philosophers <b>Aristotle
		      and Plato</b> and the writings of Muslim philosophers such as <b>al-Farabi
		      and Avicenna</b> held a great deal of interest for Al-Ghazali. There
		      had been considerable interest in Islam concerning the <b>writings
		      of the philosophers</b>, however, by the time of Al-Ghazali, there
		      was a considerable <b>backlash against Hellenistic ideas</b>.
		      It is likely therefore that Al-Ghazali's study of the philosophers
		      would have been done secretly.</p>
		  Al-Ghazali was able to bring the same <b>balanced critique</b> to
		  philosophy that he had brought to his study of theology. As a consequence
		  of this he was able to point out areas of concern while at the same time
		  embracing and making use of its positive elements. </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Use of philosophy</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p>On one hand Al-Ghazali could see <b>great potential</b> for
		    the use of philosophical thought to provide insight into and explanation
		    of Muslim ideas. On the other hand, he was <b>wary about aspects of
		    philosophy</b> which
		  were not in harmony with Muslim beliefs.		  </p>
		  <p> His concerns were mostly in the <b>area of metaphysics</b> where
  three key concepts drew his criticism. The first was that there was no <b>resurrection
  for the body</b> and that resurrection was a spiritual reality only. Secondly
  that the knowledge of Allah is limited to universal aspects and that Allah
  does not have <b>knowledge of particulars</b>. Thirdly that the world
  had existed for all time and was therefore <b>not created.</b></p>
          A number of Al-Ghazali's works focused on the area of philosophy. These
included: Masqasid al-falasifa (The Aims of the Philosophers), known simply as <b>the
Masqasid</b>, Tahafut al-falasifa (The inconsistency of the Philosophers)
known simply as <b>the Tahafut</b>, Al-Iqtisad fi-l-I'tiqad (The
Just Mean in Belief) known simply as the Iqtisad, Mizan al-`amal (The Criterion
of Action) known simply as <b>the Mizan</b> and Al-Mustasfa (The Pure
Teaching) otherwise known as <b>the Mustasfa</b>. </div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Syllogisms</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> Al-Ghazali's study of philosophy led him to find
		    considerable value in the use of <b>Aristotelian syllogisms</b> which
		    he frequently used in <b>explaining Muslim ideas</b>. This technique
		    has provided considerable opportunities for the development of learning
		    in Islam and has helped to provide a <b>rational basis</b> for
		    many aspects of Muslim belief. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Critique of Sufism</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Limit to knowledge</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Al-Ghazali found himself <b>drawn to Sufi mysticism</b> because
		    he believed that there was a limit to the knowledge that could be
		    gained through rational means and that higher learning could only be achieved
		    through <b>mystical
		    disciplines</b>. While he embraced the Sufi way of life, he remained
		    critical of some Sufi practices which disregarded the obligations
		    of Shari'ah
	      law.</p>
		  <p>He wrote the enormous and important forty volume work known as
		    the Ihya which systematically tracked the relationship between the
		    authentic Sufi life and the requirements of Shari'ah law. <b>The Ihya</b> had
		    enormous importance for the future of Sufism. The Sufi way of life had
		    often been criticised by other Muslims to the extent that some Sufi leaders
		    had even been executed as unbelievers and enemies of Islam. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Acceptance of Sufism</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> The <b>patronage of Al-Ghazali</b> led to Sufism
		    gaining a far greater acceptance and respect within Islam and has ensured
		    that is has been able to continue to grow and develop as a significant
		    element in the Islamic world. While Al-Ghazali was critical of some aspects
		    of Sufi practice, he nevertheless embraced the movement and he is now regarded
		    as one of its most <b>influential members</b>. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Synthesis of Ideas</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Critical and supportive</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>The capacity of Al-Ghazali to be <b>at once critical and supportive</b> of
		    ways of thinking was one of his greatest attributes. Rather than a wholesale
		    rejection of an approach which was flawed, he was able to critique the <b>areas
		    of concern</b> and adopt aspect which had <b>value</b>.
		    This approach was in stark contrast to the tendency to take up one position
		    and vigorously defend it against all others which prevailed at the
	      time.</p>
		  <p>Al-Ghazali's <b>measured use of different schools of thought</b> allowed
    him to avoid the type of partisan conflict that accompanied much of the scholarly
    development of Islam at the time. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Clarity and harmony</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p> An additional element of Al-Ghazali's work, arising
		    from this approach, was his ability to <b>synthesise the ideas</b> of
		    the main strands of Islamic thought. This provided considerable impetus
		    in allowing the traditions of Islam to develop with <b>clarity and
		    relative harmony</b> which may not have been possible otherwise. Through
		    Al-Ghazali's contribution, Islam has developed a maturity that allows
		    it to <b>accept the best from its diverse strands</b> rather
		    than seeking to annihilate the other through religious and political rivalry. </p>
		</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Al-Ghazali: Teacher and Writer</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		<div class="footnote"><p>Baghdad and Nishapur</p></div>
		<div class="text">
		  <p> Al-Ghazali had a <b>distinguished career</b> as both a teacher
		    and a writer. He held professorships at the prestigious Nizamiyya
		    colleges in both Baghdad and Nishapur. The role at Baghdad was perhaps
		    the most important teaching position in the Sunni Islamic world.</p>
		  <p>There are
		      over 70 extant works which are attributed to Al-Ghazali and although
		    many of them are disputed, he was, nevertheless, a prolific writer. His
		    most important works dealt <b>with
		      theology, philosophy, law and mysticism</b> </p>
		</div>
		<div class="footnote"><p>Proof of Islam</p></div>
		<div class="text"><p>It is evident, therefore, through his distinguished teaching career
		    and prolific writing that Al-Ghazali, the Proof of Islam has had <b>a
		    profound impact on the life of Islam.</b> He searching critiques of
		    theology, philosophy, law and mysticism are highly regarded by many
		    modern scholars, some of whom regard him to be the <b>greatest teacher
	      in the history of Islam.</b></p>
		  <p>His synthesis of ideas from all strands
		    and approaches of Islam has led to <b>a
  maturity and strengthening of Muslim teaching</b> and facilitated a way
  for the groups within Islam to grow together in relative harmony. </p>
