        <p>Baptism is a significant practice followed by most Christian denominations. It is used as a rite of initiation for people wishing to join the Christian community.  The core elements of the rite of baptism are the immersion in water or the sprinkling or pouring of water and the profession of faith by, or on behalf of, the person being baptised.</p>
        <p>While there is considerable variety in the forms of baptism used by various Christian denominations, the core elements of baptism in water and a profession of faith are evident across the spectrum of Christianity.</p>
        <p>Other elements that are frequently included are readings from the bible, a sermon or homily from the presiding minister, the tracing of the sign of the cross on the forehead of the person being baptised, anointing with oil, prayers for the candidate, clothing in a white garment and presentation of a lighted baptismal candle.</p>
        <p>The most common form of baptism involves the baptism of infants, however, some Christian denominations do not accept this practice and will only baptise adults who have made a conscious decision to follow the Christian faith.</p>
        <p>While baptism may be celebrated as a separate rite, there are many examples of it being incorporated into the main form of Sunday worship where the whole community is gathered.</p>

        <p>Baptism is a significant practice followed by most Christian denominations. It is used as a rite of initiation for people wishing to join the Christian community.  The rite of baptism is significant adherents of Christianity in a number of ways.</p>
        <p>Firstly it can be regarded as significant because of its ties with the earliest Christian communities and indeed with Jesus' life and ministry itself. Secondly, it can be regarded as significant for the theological reflection that if offers to both the individual and the community. Thirdly, it has enormous significance in the saving action of God and the formation of a Christian community. Finally, it has all the significance of an authentic rite of passage for both the individual and the community.</p>
        <p>The fact that baptism is an ancient ritual is significant for the individual because they walk the same path and share the same rite that has been practiced among Christians since the earliest days of the Church. It is also important for the Christian community as a whole because in celebrating each rite of baptism they are perpetuating the ancient tradition and honouring the intention of Jesus and the early disciples.</p>
        <p>The rite of baptism has great possibilities for theological reflection. The richness of this reflection is very significant for the individual. There are abundant opportunities for prayerful reflection and spiritual development in the rite of baptism. For the community, the theological richness provides a source of constant reflection and renewal. </p>
        <p>Further significance of the practice of baptism can be seen in the theological dimension of its place in the economy of salvation. This is significant for the individual who, through their baptism, receives the assurance that they have received the forgiveness of the sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit. Through baptism they are now a member of the body of Christ. The rite of baptism is a profound marker in the life of the community. It marks both their growth through the new member of the community and also is witness to their mission to bring the gospel to others. </p>
        <p>Baptism is also an authentic rite of passage, for the individual there is significance in the sense of belonging experienced, the sharing with a community of common mind and faith. The community is invigorated when it is engaged in the task of the gospel and enriched by the presence of a new member of the community.</p>

		<p><strong>Question 2 - Christianity (15 marks)</strong></p>
		<ol type="a" start="3" style="font-weight:bold;">
		  <li>Analyse how ONE significant practice within Christianity expresses the beliefs of Christianity (6)</li>
		</ol>
        <p>The practice of baptism is an important rite in most denominations of Christianity. It holds a central place as a rite of initiation and expresses many significant beliefs of the Christian tradition.</p>
        <p>The use of water as the central symbol of baptism reflects the belief in God as creator and humankind's dependence on God. It calls to mind images of the accounts of creation (Genesis 1:2), the flood (Genesis 7-8) and the Exodus. (Exodus 14).</p>
        <p>The image of water also calls to mind the image of the womb and the discussion of rebirth in water and the Spirit in John's Gospel (John 3). This imagery of this story closely parallels the Christian understanding of baptism as a rebirth from original sin into the life of the Spirit.</p>
        <p>The act of repentance proclaimed in baptism expresses the idea of turning away from sin which is integral to the practice of baptism. Christians believe that in baptism they are turning away from or renouncing sin and evil and turning in a positive way to live the life of the Spirit.</p>
        <p>The practice of baptism in the Christian tradition also expresses the belief of Christians in the Church as the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:13). In a spiritual sense, the believer is able to participate through the body of Christ in the mystery of Jesus' dying and rising.</p>
        <p>The early Church community as depicted in the Acts of the Apostles regarded baptism as a necessary element of salvation (Acts 2:38). It was a sign of their repentance, proclaimed their forgiveness from sin and allowed them to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. </p>
        <p>The symbols used during the rite of baptism also express significant beliefs of the Christian tradition. The most obvious of these is the sign of the cross which is used in a number of places in the rite. This simple symbol and ritual action expresses the Christian belief in the triune God which is at the heart of the Christian faith. </p>
        <p>The symbol of water reflects the belief in rebirth and in cleansing from sin which are at the heart of the Christian gospel. The anointing with the oil of Chrism is another important symbol. Oil is a traditional symbol for healing and strength. In baptism, Christians are anointed with oil as a sign of their mandate to share in the ministry of Jesus. The use of a white garment symbolises the purity of the baptised person and expresses the idea that in baptism the individual is cleansed from original sin. </p>

		<p><strong>Question 2 - Christianity (20 marks)</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Outline the purpose and assess the significance of ONE of the following practices in Christianity:</strong></p>
		<ul style="font-weight:bold;">
		  <li>Baptism</li>
          <li>Marriage ceremony</li>
          <li>Saturday/Sunday worship</li>		  
		</ul>
        <p>Baptism is clearly a most significant practice for most Christian denominations. It has profound significance for the person who is baptised and is also important for the Christian community as a whole. The significance can be viewed from a number of different perspectives.</p>
        <p>Firstly it can be regarded as significant because of its ties with the earliest Christian communities and indeed with the life and ministry itself. Secondly it can be regarded as significant for the theological reflection that if offers to both the individual and the community. Thirdly it has enormous significance in the saving action of God and the formation of a Christian community. Finally it has all the significance of an authentic rite of passage for both the individual and the community.</p>
        <p>Baptism is an ancient ritual. It has belonged in the life of the Christian community since its inception and indeed predates the Christian movement in the context of Judaism. It seems apparent that some Jewish groups were practising baptism prior to the ministry of Jesus. Indeed, John the Baptist, who is presented in the Gospels as a forerunner to the ministry of Jesus had baptism as the hallmark of his own ministry (Mark 1:4).</p>
        <p>Jesus himself accepted the baptism of John (Mark 1:9) and gave instructions to his followers to baptise people in his name (Matthew 28:19). Obviously the practice of baptism has great significance in the Christian tradition and indeed it relates to and expresses a number of important beliefs.</p>
        <p>For the earliest Christians baptism was a profoundly significant event and for Christians today, the possibility of sharing in an event of such ancient significance is rich and rewarding. It is significant for the individual because they walk the same path and share the same rite that has been practiced among Christians since the earliest days of the Church. It is also important for the Christian community as a whole because in celebrating each rite of baptism they are perpetuating the ancient tradition and honouring the intention of Jesus and the early disciples.</p>
        <p>The rite of baptism has great possibilities for theological reflection. There are images of death and new life which call to mind the death and resurrection of Jesus. There are also Images of creation and renewal which convey an understanding about the great saving actions of the God of Israel. Further aspects of the rite of baptism allow reflection on the struggle between good and evil in the images of light and darkness. Other images call for reflection on the idea of repentance and forgiveness as well as cleansing and renewal. Indeed it is difficult to find significant aspects of Christian theology which are not captured in the tradition, the symbols and the ritual actions associated with the practice of baptism.</p>
        <p>The richness of this reflection is very significant for the individual. Whether it be for the candidate preparing for their own baptism or a parent or God parent preparing for a child's baptism, there are abundant opportunities for prayerful reflection and spiritual development in the rite of baptism. Many Churches invite candidates to prepare for baptism or to prepare for their role as parents or God parents through engaging in a preparation course which helps them make connections between theological themes and their own experience.</p>
        <p>For the community, the theological richness provides a source of constant reflection and renewal. Many Christian communities invite congregations to renew their own baptismal promises on the occasion of baptisms in the local Church community. These occasions challenge the members of the community to constantly reflect on their vocation as Christians and the significance of their own baptism. The involvement of the community in assisting candidates prepare for their baptism and praying for those involved is yet another dimension of the significance for the community.</p>
        <p>Further significance of the practice of baptism can be seen in the theological dimension of its place in the economy of salvation. The early Church community as depicted in the Acts of the Apostles regarded baptism as a necessary element of salvation (Acts 2:38). It was a sign of their repentance, proclaimed their forgiveness from sin and allowed them to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The beliefs that baptism is integral to salvation, that it signifies repentance and forgiveness of sin and that it allows for the coming of the Spirit are important beliefs of the Christian faith that are expressed in the practice of baptism.</p>
        <p>This is significant for the individual who through their baptism receives the assurance that they have received the forgiveness of the sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit. Through baptism they are now a member of the body of Christ. The rite of baptism is a profound marker in the life of the community. It marks both their growth through the new member of the community and also is witness to their mission to bring the gospel to others. </p>
        <p>Baptism is also an authentic rite of passage. It marks the transition of the individual from one stage or state in life onto the next. In terms of the Christian community it marks the transition of a person from being outside of this community to becoming a fully initiated. </p>
        <p>Thus for the individual there is significance in the sense of belonging experienced, the sharing with a community of common mind and faith. For the community, the process of supporting a person through their preparation and welcoming them into the community through baptism is also highly significant. The community is invigorated when it is engaged in the task of the gospel and enriched by the presence of a new member of the community.</p>
