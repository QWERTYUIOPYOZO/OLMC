		<h2>Baptism and the Beliefs of Christianity</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Ancient origins</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The origins of the practice of baptism are quite ancient, pre-dating Christianity itself. It seems apparent that some <strong>Jewish groups</strong> were practising baptism prior to the ministry of Jesus. Indeed, <strong>John the Baptist</strong>, who is presented in the Gospels as a forerunner to the ministry of Jesus had baptism as the hallmark of his own ministry (Mark 1:4).</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Jesus' baptism</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Jesus himself accepted the <strong>baptism of John</strong> (Mark 1:9) and gave instructions to his followers to baptise people <strong>in his name</strong> (Matthew 28:19). Obviously the practice of baptism has great significance in the Christian tradition and indeed it relates to and expresses a number of important beliefs.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Water the central symbol</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The use of water as the central symbol of baptism reflects the belief in God as creator and humankind's dependence on God. It calls to mind images of the waters of chaos from the Genesis accounts of <strong>creation</strong> (Genesis 1:2) as well as the destructive power of <strong>the flood</strong> in the story of Noah (Genesis 7-8) and finally the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea in the accounts of <strong>the Exodus</strong> (Exodus 14).</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Water and the Spirit</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The image of water also calls to mind the image of the womb and the discussion of rebirth in water and the Spirit in <strong>John's Gospel</strong> (John 3). This imagery of this story closely parallels the Christian understanding of baptism as a rebirth from original sin into the <strong>life of the Spirit</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Repentance</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The Christian understanding of baptism contains a sense of the repentance highlighted in the ministry of <strong>John the Baptist</strong>, even though John himself announced that his ministry was only a preparation for the one who was to come (Matthew 3). Despite this, the act of repentance proclaimed in John's baptism expresses the idea of turning away from sin which is integral to the practice of baptism. Christians believe that in baptism they are <strong>turning away</strong> from or renouncing sin and evil and turning in a positive way to live the life of the Spirit.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Body of Christ</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The practice of baptism in the Christian tradition also expresses the belief of Christians in the <strong>Church as the body of Christ</strong> (1 Corinthians 12:13). Christians are baptised into the Church, which is the body of Christ, and as a consequence of becoming part of this body the believer is able to experience more fully the significance of the <strong>death and resurrection of Jesus</strong>. In a spiritual sense, the believer is able to participate through the body of Christ in the mystery of Jesus' dying and rising.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Early Church</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The early Church community as depicted in the Acts of the Apostles regarded baptism as a <strong>necessary element of salvation</strong> (Acts 2:38). It was a sign of their repentance, proclaimed their <strong>forgiveness from sin</strong> and allowed them to receive the <strong>gift of the Holy Spirit</strong>. The beliefs that baptism is integral to salvation, that it signifies repentance and forgiveness of sin and that it allows for the coming of the Spirit are important beliefs of the Christian faith that are expressed in the practice of baptism.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Symbols and ritual actions</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The symbols used during the rite of baptism also express significant beliefs of the Christian tradition. The most obvious of these is the <strong>sign of the cross</strong> which is used in a number of places in the rite. This simple symbol and ritual action expresses the Christian belief in the triune God which is at the heart of the Christian faith.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Symbolism of water</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The water is another important symbol and, as it has already been noted, one that provides rich symbolism and links to many ideas in the Christian tradition. The symbol of water reflects the belief in <strong>rebirth</strong> and in <strong>cleansing</strong> from sin which are at the heart of the Christian gospel.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Anointing</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The anointing with the oil of Chrism is another important symbol. Oil is a traditional symbol for <strong>healing and strength</strong> and is also used in the sense of mandating or setting someone aside for a purpose. This sense is seen in the <strong>anointing of a king</strong> such as the anointing of Saul, the first king of the Jewish nation (1 Samuel 10:1-3). In baptism, Christians are anointed with oil as a sign of their mandate to share in the <strong>ministry of Jesus</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>White garment</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Another symbol is found in the use of a white garment. This symbolises the purity of the baptised person and expresses the idea that in baptism the individual is <strong>cleansed from original sin</strong>. Baptism is therefore a new beginning for Christians.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Baptismal candle</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The giving of a candle to the parents and God parents or to the newly baptised person also conveys significant expressions of Christian belief. On one hand it brings to mind notions of Jesus being the <strong>light of the world</strong> (John 8:12) as well as the word of God being a guiding light for people to follow (Psalm 119:105). The image of the light also symbolises the conflict between <strong>good and evil</strong> and the idea of light dispelling the darkness in and through the ministry of Jesus (John 1:4-6). Finally the symbol of the light expresses the idea of the gifts bestowed on the individual and their responsibility to use these gifts in <strong>service to others</strong> (Matthew 5:16).</p>
