		<h2>The Significance of Baptism for Individuals and the Christian Community</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		  <div class="footnote"><p /></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Baptism is clearly a most significant practice for most Christian denominations. It has profound significance for the person who is baptised and is also important for the Christian community as a whole. The significance can be viewed from a number of different perspectives.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Links to earliest Christian Churches</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Firstly it can be regarded as significant because of its ties with the earliest Christian communities and indeed with <strong>Jesus' life and ministry</strong> itself. Secondly, it can be regarded as significant for the <strong>theological reflection</strong> that if offers to both the individual and the community. Thirdly, it has enormous significance in the <strong>saving action of God</strong> and the formation of a Christian community. Finally, it has all the significance of an authentic <strong>rite of passage</strong> for both the individual and the community.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Ancient Rite</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Baptism is an ancient ritual. It has belonged in the life of the Christian community since its inception and indeed <strong>predates the Christian movement</strong> in the context of Judaism. It seems apparent that some Jewish groups were practising baptism prior to the ministry of Jesus. Indeed, <strong>John the Baptist</strong>, who is presented in the Gospels as a forerunner to the ministry of Jesus, had baptism as the hallmark of his own ministry (Mark 1:4).</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Jesus' baptism</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Jesus himself accepted the <strong>baptism of John</strong> (Mark 1:9) and gave instructions to his followers to baptise people <strong>in his name</strong> (Matthew 28:19). Obviously the practice of baptism has great significance in the Christian tradition and indeed it relates to and expresses a number of important beliefs.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Links to early Christian Church</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>For the earliest Christians baptism was a profoundly significant event and for Christians today, the possibility of sharing in an <strong>event of such ancient significance</strong> is rich and rewarding. It is significant for the individual because they walk the same path and share the same rite that has been practiced among Christians since the <strong>earliest days of the Church</strong>. It is also important for the Christian community as a whole because in celebrating each rite of baptism they are perpetuating the ancient tradition and honouring the intention of Jesus and the early disciples.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Theological reflection</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The rite of baptism has great possibilities for theological reflection. There are images of <strong>death and new life</strong> which call to mind the death and resurrection of Jesus. There are also images of <strong>creation and renewal</strong> which convey an understanding about the great saving actions of the God of Israel. Further aspects of the rite of baptism allow reflection on the struggle between <strong>good and evil</strong> in the images of light and darkness. Other images call for reflection on the idea of <strong>repentance and forgiveness</strong> as well as cleansing and renewal. Indeed it is difficult to find significant aspects of Christian theology which are not captured in the tradition, the symbols and the ritual actions associated with the practice of baptism.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Preparation for Baptism</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The richness of this reflection is very significant for the individual. Whether it be for the candidate preparing for their own baptism or a parent or God parent preparing for a child's baptism, there are abundant opportunities for <strong>prayerful reflection and spiritual development</strong> in the rite of baptism. Many Churches invite candidates to prepare for baptism or to prepare for their role as parents or God parents through engaging in a <strong>preparation course</strong> which helps them make connections between theological themes and their own experience.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Reflection and renewal</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>For the community, the theological richness provides a source of constant reflection and renewal. Many Christian communities invite congregations to <strong>renew their own baptismal promises</strong> on the occasion of baptisms in the local Church community. These occasions challenge the members of the community to constantly reflect on their <strong>vocation</strong> as Christians and the significance of their own baptism. The involvement of the community in assisting candidates prepare for their baptism and praying for those involved is yet another dimension of the significance for the community.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Theological dimension</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Further significance of the practice of baptism can be seen in the theological dimension of its place in the <strong>economy of salvation</strong>. The early Church community as depicted in the Acts of the Apostles regarded baptism as a necessary <strong>element of salvation</strong> (Acts 2:38). It was a sign of their repentance, proclaimed their forgiveness from sin and allowed them to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The beliefs that baptism is <strong>integral to salvation</strong>, that it signifies repentance and forgiveness of sin and that it allows for the coming of the Spirit are important beliefs of the Christian faith that are expressed in the practice of baptism.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Gift of the Holy Spirit</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>This is significant for the individual who, through their baptism, receives the assurance that they have received the <strong>forgiveness of the sins</strong> and the <strong>gift of the Holy Spirit</strong>. Through baptism they are now a member of the body of Christ. The rite of baptism is a profound marker in the life of the community. It marks both their growth through the new member of the community and also is witness to their mission to bring the gospel to others.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Rite of passage</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Baptism is also an authentic rite of passage. It marks the <strong>transition</strong> of the individual <strong>from one stage or state in life onto the next</strong>. In terms of the Christian community it marks the transition of a person from being outside of this community to becoming a fully initiated.</p>
			<p>Thus for the individual there is significance in the <strong>sense of belonging</strong> experienced, the sharing with a community of <strong>common mind and faith</strong>. For the community, the process of supporting a person through their preparation and welcoming them into the community through baptism is also highly significant. The community is invigorated when it is engaged in the task of the gospel and enriched by the presence of a new member of the community.</p>
