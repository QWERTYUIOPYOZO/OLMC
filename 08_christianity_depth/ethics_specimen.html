        <p>The teaching of the Christian tradition is drawn from a combination of sources, firstly from the biblical tradition, secondly from the examples of individuals and communities in history and thirdly from the leaders of the various denominations who have provided recent leadership in this field in response to a growing awareness of the ecological crisis.</p>
        <p>The biblical tradition of Christianity shows that there is a special relationship between humankind and the environment because they are both created by God.

        <p>The involvement of the Christian Churches is a relatively recent development. Prior to the last fifty years there was very little emphasis on this aspect in Christian teaching.

		  <li>Analyse Christian ethical teachings with reference to ONE significant area (6)</li>	  	  
		</ol>
        <p>Christian ethical teaching on environmental ethics is drawn principally from a biblical tradition which highlights the fact that God is the creator of all things and that human beings have a responsibility to work in partnership with God to ensure that the fragile environment is nurtured and protected. This rich tradition has been embraced at various times throughout history but it is only in recent decades that a considerable, consistent emphasis has been placed on this teaching.</p>
        <p>It is evident that the growing social awareness of the ecological crisis has prompted Christian Churches to reflect seriously on their responsibility in this area. </p>
        <p>Even as recently as fifty years ago there was little emphasis given to environmental ethics in Christian teaching. Increasingly today, however, there is an urgent call for Christians to act responsibly towards the created world and to guard against its exploitation.</p>
        <p>The biblical tradition of Christianity shows that there is a special relationship between humankind and the environment because they are both created by God. Christian ethical teaching also shows that both reflect the glory of God and convey the image of God. It also recognises that God has commanded human beings to live in fruitful relationship with the earth and that humankind has a requirement of stewardship of the earth.</p>

Other theologians have focused on the spiritual and mystical element which draws people to view the environment more as a tangible expression of God rather than something separate from God. </p>
        <p>Despite the considerable development in emphasis in recent times, it is clear that, in the Western world, environmental ethics is yet to truly become a significant focus of most Christian communities at the local level. </p>

		<p><strong>Question 2 - Christianity (20 marks)</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Describe Christian ethical teachings on ONE of the following:</strong></p>
		<ul style="font-weight:bold">
          <li>bioethics</li>
          <li>environmental ethics</li>
          <li>sexual ethics</li>			
	    </ul>
        <p>Despite having a rich biblical tradition on ecology and some outstanding examples of individuals who have provided leadership in the field, the extent of Christian ethical teaching in the area of environmental ethics has been quite limited. While the Christian biblical tradition provides significant guidance in the field of environmental ethics, it has to be said that until recent times there has been little done by the Christian Churches in the field of environmental ethics. <p>
        <p>Even in today's world, with the growing social awareness of an environmental crisis, Christian Churches in the richer industrialised world have made very little progress in engaging people in environmental ethics.<p>
        <p>In order to properly explain Christian teaching on environmental ethics it will be necessary to look at the biblical tradition, consider some historical examples and also examine the developments of recent decades where Christian Churches have made a more urgent attempt to address the issue.<p>
        <p>The bulk of examples from the biblical tradition come from the Old Testament. There are few specific examples which can be taken from the New Testament literature. Some of the principal sources of Old Testament teaching include the creation stories of Genesis 1 and 2 which incorporate key texts such as the instruction to subdue and have dominion over the earth (1:28) and the responsibility to till the earth and make it fruitful (2:15). These passages highlight the notion of stewardship which is at the heart of Christian teaching on environmental ethics. <p>
        <p>Further examples speak of a reverence for creation and include reminders to humankind that they are but one aspect of God's creation. Passages from the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy also provide teachings against needless destruction, provisions to ensure that a species is not made extinct and instructions on agricultural practices to ensure that fields are not over farmed.<p>
        <p>In the New Testament, Jesus' teaching on the Reign of God with its emphasis on harmony and justice in relationships also provides a sound platform for modern environmental ethics.<p>
        <p>Christian ethical thinking acknowledges that there is a special relationship between humankind and the environment because both humankind and rest of the created world are created by God. Christians acknowledge that both humankind and the rest of the created world reflect the glory of God and convey the image of God. They also recognise that God commanded human beings to live in fruitful relationship with the earth and that humankind has a requirement of stewardship of the earth.<p>
        <p>There have always been individual and communities within the Christian tradition who have provided examples of leadership in this field, however, it has not been a prominent concern for Christians overall. <p>
        <p>These examples include Francis of Assisi and Hildegard of Bingen. Francis is well known for his decision to reject a life of wealth and power to live in harmony with nature. He is also revered for his writings celebrating the natural world and his practical concern for all of creation. Hildegard excelled in the studying the natural world and drawing from its healing powers. Her writings, music and art are also impressive celebrations of the wonder of creation.<p>
        <p>Despite the calibre of people such as Francis and Hildegard, the Church does not have a great history of leadership and guidance in the field of environmental ethics. It is only in recent decades, spurred by a growing awareness of the ecological crisis, that the Christian Churches have begun to respond in a significant way.<p>
        <p>Christian theologians and activists such as Sallie McFague and Sean McDonagh have explored the connection between ecology and other significant social issues such as justice, peace and feminism. Meanwhile writers such as Thomas Berry and Matthew Fox have challenged traditional ways of viewing creation and called Christians to see creation as a tangible expression of God rather than something separate that God has created.<p>
        <p>In recent times, there have been many significant statements and other initiatives developed by Church leaders both within Australia and internationally, however, there is still an absence of widespread engagement at the grass roots levels of Church communities. Statements such as Pope John Paul II's &quot;Peace with God the Creator, Peace with all of Creation&quot; and the World Council of Churches' appeal for a partnership of science and religion are landmark initiatives.<p>
        <p>Within Australia, the National Council of Churches' initiatives through their Decade to Overcome Violence and the Catholic Church's establishment of Catholic Earthcare Australia are also very significant initiatives.<p>
        <p>While most Christian communities tacitly recognise the importance of environmental ethics, it is yet to become a major focus of day to day life for most Christians and their local Church communities.<p>
        <p>In the present climate of increased environmental awareness there remains a wide range of perspectives among the Churches. Liberal members of the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant Churches are generally very aware of teaching on environmental ethics and are often active in response to the issues raised. Conservative members of these same denominations are less likely to be engaged in environmental issues in a significant way.<p>
        <p>Some of the fundamentalist and evangelical Churches have been reluctant to place significant emphasis on environmental concerns as any form of transformative social action is seen as a low priority in comparison to evangelisation in the light of the anticipated return of Jesus and the end of the world.<p>
        <p>Thus, it is evident that there is a richness in the tradition of Christian teaching on environmental ethics and a clear rhetoric calling for action in recent times. However, there remains a considerable challenge in education and action to engage significant numbers of local Christian communities in significant environmental actions. This challenge is particularly evident in Western industrialised countries where Christian communities enjoy high standards of living which depend on significant and often negligent use of the world's resources. <p>
        <p>In poorer parts of the world, there is considerable engagement of Christian communities on environmental issues. This is because for Christians in these parts of the world environmental degradation is an issue which is affecting them in a very serious and tangible way through a lack of clean drinking water, rising sea levels, damage to crops etc. People in richer countries are largely insulated against these challenges, although it is clear that this insulation is a temporary thing and that within decades more affluent countries will be faced with similar environmental disasters.<p>
        <p>It can be concluded, therefore, that while Christian teaching on environmental ethics is based on a rich biblical and historical tradition, it is only in the last few decades that it has begun to be pursued with any great urgency. Many important initiatives have been undertaken both with Australia and internationally, however, there is still considerable work to be done in engaging Christian Churches in the Western industrialised world. For many in the West, ecology is not yet a critical issue, despite the evidence that it will soon be so.<p>
