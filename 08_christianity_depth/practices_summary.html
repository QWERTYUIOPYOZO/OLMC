		<p class="section_statement">demonstrate how this practice expresses the beliefs of Christianity</p>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Origins of the practice of baptism are ancient </li>
          <li>Pre-date Christianity itself</li>
          <li>Some Jewish groups were practising baptism prior to the ministry of Jesus. </li>
          <li>John the Baptist had baptism as the hallmark of his ministry (Mark 1:4).</li>
          <li>Jesus accepted the baptism of John (Mark 1:9) </li>
          <li>Gave instructions to his followers to baptise people in his name (Matthew 28:19) Baptism has great significance in the Christian tradition </li>
          <li>Expresses a number of important beliefs.</li>
          <li>Water as the central symbol of baptism reflects the belief in God as creator and humankind's dependence on God</li>
          <li>Calls to mind images of the waters of chaos from the Genesis accounts of creation (Genesis 1:2) </li>
          <li>The destructive power of the flood in the story of Noah (Genesis 7-8) </li>
          <li>The miraculous crossing of the Red Sea in the accounts of the Exodus (Exodus 14)</li>
          <li>Image of water also calls to mind the image of the womb and the discussion of rebirth in water and the Spirit in John's Gospel (John 3) </li>
          <li>This imagery of this story closely parallels the Christian understanding of baptism as a rebirth from original sin into the life of the Spirit</li>
          <li>Christian understanding of baptism contains a sense of the repentance highlighted in the ministry of John the Baptist </li>
          <li>John announced that his ministry was only a preparation for the one who was to come (Matthew 3) </li>
          <li>The act of repentance proclaimed in John's baptism expresses the idea of turning away from sin which is integral to the practice of baptism</li>
          <li>Christians believe that in baptism they are turning away from or renouncing sin and evil and turning in a positive way to live the life of the Spirit</li>
          <li>Baptism also expresses the belief of Christians in the Church as the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:13)</li>
          <li>Christians are baptised into the Church, which is the body of Christ</li>
          <li>As a consequence of becoming part of this body the believer is able to experience more fully the significance of the death and resurrection of Jesus </li>
          <li>In a spiritual sense, the believer is able to participate through the body of Christ in the mystery of Jesus' dying and rising</li>
          <li>Early Church community as depicted in the Acts of the Apostles regarded baptism as a necessary element of salvation (Acts 2:38) </li>
          <li>Sign of their repentance, proclaimed their forgiveness from sin and allowed them to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit </li>
          <li>The beliefs that baptism is integral to salvation, that it signifies repentance and forgiveness of sin and that it allows for the coming of the Spirit are important beliefs of the Christian faith that are expressed in the practice of baptism</li>
          <li>Symbols used during the rite of baptism also express significant beliefs of the Christian tradition</li>
          <li>Sign of the cross is used in a number of places in the rite </li>
          <li>This simple symbol and ritual action expresses the Christian belief in the triune God which is at the heart of the Christian faith</li>
          <li>Water is another important symbol and links to many ideas in the Christian tradition</li>
          <li>Water reflects the belief in rebirth and in cleansing from sin which are at the heart of the Christian gospel</li>
          <li>The anointing with the oil of Chrism is another important symbol</li>
          <li>Oil is a traditional symbol for healing and strength </li>
          <li>Also used in the sense of mandating or setting someone aside for a purpose </li>
          <li>Seen in the anointing of a king such as the anointing of Saul (1 Samuel 10:1-3)</li>
          <li>Christians are anointed with oil as a sign of their mandate to share in the ministry of Jesus</li>
          <li>Another symbol is the use of a white garment</li>
          <li>This symbolises the purity of the baptised person</li> 
          <li>Expresses the idea that in baptism the individual is cleansed from original sin</li>
          <li>Baptism is therefore a new beginning for Christians</li>
          <li>The giving of a candle to the parents and God parents or to the newly baptised person also conveys significant expressions of Christian belief </li>
          <li>It brings to mind notions of Jesus being the light of the world (John 8:12) </li>
          <li>The word of God being a guiding light for people to follow (Psalm 119:105) </li>
          <li>Symbolises the conflict between good and evil</li>
          <li>Light dispelling the darkness in and through the ministry of Jesus (John 1:4-6) Expresses the idea of the gifts bestowed on the individual and their responsibility to use these gifts in service to others (Matthew 5:16)		</li>

          <li>Richness of this reflection is very significant for the individual</li>
          <li>Opportunities for prayerful reflection and spiritual development in the rite of baptism</li>
          <li>Many Churches have preparation courses which help make connections between theological themes and life experience</li>
          <li>For the community, the theological richness provides a source of constant reflection and renewal</li>
          <li>Many Christian communities invite congregations to renew their own baptismal promises. </li>
          <li>This challenges the members of the community to constantly reflect on their vocation as Christians and the significance of their own baptism </li>
          <li>Involvement of the community in assisting candidates prepare for their baptism and praying for those involved is another dimension of the significance for the community</li>

          <li>Through baptism they are now a member of the body of Christ</li>
          <li>The rite of baptism is a profound marker in the life of the community </li>
          <li>Marks both their growth through the new member of the community and also is witness to their mission to bring the gospel to others</li>
