		<h3>Environmental Ethics in Christian History</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>until the last few decades there have been few examples of environmental awareness in the Christian tradition</li>
          <li>environmental ethics  not prominent in the mainstream of Christian thought and practice until quite recently</li>
          <li>with the advent of a global concern for ecology Christian theology has embraced environmental ethics in a substantial response</li>
          <li>Christian theologians are now making more substantial use of the biblical reflections on creation as well as the work of historical figures such as Francis of Assisi, Hildegard of Bingen and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin</li>		
		</ul>
		<h3>Biblical Reflections on Environment</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Christian scriptures have a number of ecological themes, many are taken from the Old Testament</li>
          <li>few specific teachings on environment to be found in the New Testament</li>
          <li>some important principles in the teachings of Jesus have significance for environmental ethics.</li>
          <li>creation stories of Genesis 1-2  provide the accounts of creation</li>
          <li>also provide important insights concerning creation and the relationships and responsibilities that exist between God, humankind and the rest of the created order</li>
          <li>Christians draw religious truths from these texts</li>
          <li>God is the creator of all things</li>
          <li>there is a close relationship between God and the created world</li>
          <li>the created world is a good thing</li>
          <li>human beings have a particular responsibility, known as stewardship, for the created world </li>
          <li>failure to fulfill this responsibility of stewardship will inevitably lead to undesirable consequences for humankind.</li>
          <li>one of the more significant verses in this section of the Bible is Genesis 1:28 includes the instructions to have dominion and to subdue the earth</li>
          <li>these instructions which have contributed to the historical exploitation of the environment </li>
          <li>also to the understanding that humankind had been given license to freely use the world's resources</li>
          <li>contemporary interpretations of this text highlight the mutual relationship which exists between humankind and the rest of creation</li>
          <li>world provides resources needed for human life</li>
          <li>negligent use of these resources will lead to environmental degradation and a loss of the capacity of the earth to provide</li>
          <li>the passage forms part of the teaching on stewardship in the Christian tradition</li>
          <li>Christians are taught that they have a fundamental responsibility to care for creation </li>
          <li>they are God's partners in creation </li>
          <li>responsible for ensuring that it is nurtured and cared for in sustainable ways </li>
          <li>Christian understanding of stewardship guards against selfish or careless exploitation of the world's resources</li>
          <li>Genesis 2:15 speaks of God placing humankind in the garden and instructing them to till it and guard it</li>
          <li>these instructions highlight the Christian understanding of stewardship</li>
          <li>earth's resources will provide for human need</li>
          <li>humankind has a responsibility to protect environment and ensure it remains fruitful</li>
          <li>passages anticipating future messianic times also convey some important environmental themes</li>
          <li>prophecies found in Isaiah 11:1-9 and Joel 2:21-26 show a flourishing environment and a state of harmony between humankind and the rest of creation</li>
          <li>messianic visions reflect beliefs of a future time where people will live according to the will of God</li>
          <li>environmental wellbeing is integral to this vision.</li>
          <li>Deuteronomy 20:19-20 includes instructions about the conduct of a siege in the context of war</li>
          <li>prohibits the wanton destruction of the crops of the besieged city </li>
          <li>highlights the wrong involved in any needless destruction of the natural environment</li>
          <li>Old Testament teaches responsible agricultural practices</li>
          <li>fields are to lie fallow every seventh year in order to ensure the continued fertility of the soil and to guard against over taxing its resources (Leviticus 25:5-6)</li>
          <li>further teachings prevent hunters from killing the adult and its offspring on the same day (Deuteronomy 22:6-7 &amp; Leviticus 22:28)</li>
          <li>prevents the destruction of a species which would result if a generation was not able to reproduce</li>
          <li>provision in a number of texts for animals to be given the same Sabbath rest as humans enjoy. (Exodus 20:11, Exodus 23:12, Deuteronomy 5:14)</li>
          <li>two other elements of ecology are also found in the Old Testament</li>
          <li>reverence and respect for creation which is espoused in the Psalms</li> 
          <li>sober assessment of the relative insignificance of humanity in the light of the wonders of creation found in the book of Job 39-41</li>
          <li>these examples challenge an androcentric view which exalts humankind over the rest of creation and which leads inevitably to its exploitation</li>
          <li>lack of specific environmental teaching in the canon of the New Testament</li> 
          <li>some important themes and particular texts which provide significant material for reflection.</li>
          <li>theme of the reign of God</li>
          <li>all pervading theme in the synoptic gospels occurring in over seventy five places teaching of Jesus about the reign of God has little explicit or direct reference to the environment</li>
          <li>implicitly it is a rich source of environmental ethics </li>
          <li>Jesus teaching on the reign of God extols the virtues of respect, consideration, harmony and balance etc which are at the heart of modern environmental ethics </li>
          <li>Matthew 6:28-31 uses the example of the natural world to convey the ways of God to listeners</li>
          <li>balance and simplicity of nature are placed before followers as worthy of contemplation in order to more perfectly respond to the will of God</li>		
		</ul>
		<h3>Historical Examples of Environmental Concern</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Christians have primarily operated out of an anthropocentric view of the world focused on the primacy and supremacy of humankind in the created order </li>
          <li>beliefs arose from the biblical command of Genesis 1:28 to &quot;have dominion over. and subdue the earth&quot;</li> 
          <li>seen as a license to freely use the world's resources </li>
          <li>sanctioned the free use of the world's resources for the goal human advancement</li>
          <li>recognition of the fragility of the environment and the limited extent of the world's resources is a relatively recent development</li>
          <li>pre industrialised societies have had a far lesser impact on the environment than that of modern communities </li>
          <li>theologians throughout the history of Christianity were largely unaware of their responsibilities towards the environment</li>
          <li>focus had frequently been on the ability and capacity of humankind to harness the world's resources in more sophisticated and efficient way</li>
          <li>popularised by  Rene Descartes who extolled the virtue of humankind demonstrating its ingenuity and capability through more complete &quot;mastery of nature&quot;</li>
          <li>Christian theologians saw that it was important for human beings to fully utilise the gifts and talents provided by their creator </li>
          <li>to use their intelligence and ingenuity to exploit the world's resources and control the natural environment was in fact a form of worship of the creator</li>
          <li>theologies such as this were developed in the absence of any understanding about the potential of humankind to damage and destroy the natural world</li>
          <li>Christian history as a whole has not been alert to the importance of environmental ethics </li>
          <li>there have been significant individuals who have made important contributions to environmental awareness.</li>
          <li>Francis of Assisi rejected wealth and power to live in harmony with nature</li>
          <li>Francis celebrated nature as vision of God</li>
          <li>famous for his prayers and meditations on the beauty of creation as well as his practical concern for all of God's creation</li>
          <li>Hildegard of Bingen was a leader of a monastic community in the 12th century She was a famous student of nature who investigated and made use of the healing qualities of nature </li>
          <li>she taught of the need to respect nature and learn from it</li>
          <li>her writings, music and art all reflect a profound sense of oneness with creation and an immense respect for the work of the creator</li>
          <li>Pierre Teilhard de Chardin is highly regarded for his reflections in the fields of science, philosophy and theology</li>
          <li>he proposed that matter is impregnated with purposeful energy that constantly evolves towards a greater complexity</li>
          <li>matter is not merely an inert mass</li>
          <li>it is the indispensable pre condition for spirit and is the basic building block of life</li>
          <li>with the increasing social awareness of ecology, Christian theologians have presented important insights into environmental ethics</li>
          <li>not only informing the understanding of Christian adherents but are also contributing to dialogues with scientists, economists and politicians throughout the world</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Modern Environmental Ethics</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>modern Christian thinkers have made enormous contributions to environmental awareness </li>
          <li>for many Christians environmental ethics remains a side issue</li>
          <li>Church leaders have universally stated the urgency and priority of environmental action</li>
          <li>Pope John Paul II has made important contributions to environmental ethics</li>

          <li>direct focus on calling on the Australian Government to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change
		</ul>
		<h3>Modern Contributions to Environmental Ethics</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>many important theologians and activists who are working in the field of environmental ethics</li>
          <li>calling on the Churches to act urgently and more decisively in the field of ecology</li>
          <li>critical of the Churches for their tardiness in taking serious steps in responding to environmental issues and strongly challenged the Christian tradition as a whole</li>
          <li>examples of these are:</li>
          <li>Sallie McFague from the liberal protestant tradition</li>
          <li>feminist theologian who is setting out to construct a new theology of nature and of God </li>
          <li>connects God with the human process rather than distances God from creation need to develop a new metaphor for God which recognises that the world is the physical expression of God not a separate &quot;product&quot; of God</li>
          <li>Thomas Berry, Catholic theologian born in 1914 was a member of the Passionist Order of Priests</li>
          <li>Berry espoused a mystical approach to ecology</li>
          <li>argued that God made the world and therefore God is profoundly related to it  </li>
          <li>if we lose our sense of the splendour of the natural world then we also lose our sense of the divine </li>
          <li>Berry suggested that human beings must see themselves in perspective i.e. only existing for about 60,000 years in a cosmos as much as 15,000,000,000 years old </li>
          <li>cosmos is to be seen as an ongoing energy event rather than a sudden creation at a specific point in time</li>
          <li>stresses that human beings as creatures are not separate from the rest of creation who can be valued over and against the rest of creation  </li>
          <li>he says that we need to develop a new creation story (myth) which takes into account our now more developed sense of awareness of the human impact on the environment and the growing sense of profound unity with the environment</li>
          <li>Matthew Fox was a Catholic theologian born 1940</li>
          <li>He was a member of the Dominican Order of Priests before ultimately being expelled by his order after long running disputes with Rome </li>
          <li>has now been accepted into the Episcopalian church </li>
          <li>Fox proposes a mystical approach to the environment known now as Creation Spirituality</li>
          <li>idea of original blessing i.e. an ancient notion that the cosmos has been continually blessing (bringing life to) human beings since their evolution</li>
          <li>this idea stands in contrast to the idea of original sin which Fox identifies as a very recent idea </li>
          <li>Sean McDonagh is a Catholic missionary Priest</li>
          <li>member of the Columban order of Priests</li>
          <li>worked extensively in the Philippines</li>
          <li>McDonagh focuses on the relationship between justice and ecology </li>
          <li>approach is called eco-justice</li>
          <li>McDonagh identifies the type of greed and exploitation which is at the heart of injustice to be the same factors which are at the heart of environmental degradation</li>
          <li>identifies that significant amounts of environmental degradation take place through the exploitative action of the rich and the practices which are forced upon the poor, particularly in the need to meet debt repayments </li>
          <li>McDonagh has been a strong critic of the lack of involvement of the Church in environmental issues</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Overview of Environmental Ethics</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Christian biblical tradition provides significant guidance in the field of environmental ethics</li>
          <li>until recent times there has been little done by the Christian Churches in the field of environmental ethics</li>
          <li>always been individual and communities within the Christian tradition who have provided examples of leadership in this field</li>
          <li>has not been a prominent concern for Christians overall</li>
          <li>many recent significant statements and other initiatives developed by Church leaders both within Australia and internationally</li>
          <li>still an absence of widespread engagement at the grass roots levels of Church communities</li>
          <li>most Christian communities tacitly recognise the importance of environmental ethics</li>
          <li>yet to become a major focus of day to day life for most Christians and their local Church communities</li>
          <li>wide range of perspectives among the Churches </li>
          <li>liberal members of the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant Churches are generally very aware of teaching on environmental ethics and are often active in response to the issues raised</li>
          <li>conservative members of these same denominations are less likely to be engaged in environmental issues in a significant way</li>
          <li>some of the fundamentalist and evangelical Churches have been reluctant to place significant emphasis on environmental concerns as any form of transformative social action </li>
          <li>seen as a low priority in comparison to evangelisation in the light of the anticipated return of Jesus and the end of the world</li>
          <li>Christian thinking acknowledges that there is a special relationship between humankind and the environment</li>
          <li>both humankind and rest of the created world are created by God</li>
          <li>both reflect the glory of God and convey the image of God</li>
          <li>recognise that God commanded human beings to live in fruitful relationship with the earth </li>
          <li>humankind has a requirement of stewardship of the earth.</li>
          <li>richness in the tradition of Christian teaching on environmental ethics and a clear rhetoric calling for action in recent times</li>
          <li>considerable challenge in education and action to engage significant numbers of local Christian communities in significant environmental actions. This challenge is particularly evident in Western industrialised countries where Christian communities enjoy high standards of living which depend on significant and often negligent use of the world's resources</li>
          <li>in poorer parts of the world, there is considerable engagement of Christian communities on environmental issues </li>
          <li>because for Christians in these parts of the world environmental degradation is an issue which is affecting them in a very serious and tangible way </li>
          <li>through a lack of clean drinking water, rising sea levels, damage to crops etc richer countries are  insulated against these challenges</li>
          <li>this insulation is a temporary thing </li>
          <li>within decades more affluent countries will be faced with similar environmental disasters</li>
