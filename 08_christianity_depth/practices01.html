		<h2>Description of Baptism</h2>
		<div class="content2">
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Initiation rite</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Baptism is the ritual used in <strong>most Christian denominations</strong> to signify the person's initiation into the <strong>beliefs and practices</strong> of the Christian community. For most Christian denominations it also has significance as a statement of a person's beliefs in the Christian tradition and as a necessary element for salvation. Baptism also allows Christians to share in the death and resurrection of Christ and cleanses people from their sins. The <strong>Salvation Army</strong> and the <strong>Society of Friends</strong> (Quakers) are examples of Christian groups which do not practice baptism.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Infant baptism</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>For the <strong>majority of Christians</strong> today Baptism would have been carried out when they were infants. This is the common practice in the <strong>Anglican, Catholic and Orthodox</strong> branches of Christianity. In this context the parents and God parents make commitments on behalf of the child and agree to nurture the child in the Christian faith.  In other Christian groups such as the <strong>Baptist and Pentecostal Churches</strong> the baptism of infants is <strong>not accepted</strong> and members would be expected to choose to be baptised as adults having made their own decision to repent and be born again.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Immersion</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The idea of baptism stems from the sense of being <strong>immersed in water</strong>, which, among other things, symbolises the idea of being surrounded by and imbued with the <strong>beliefs and practices</strong> of the Christian community. Some theologians liken the symbolism of immersion to that of being completely saturated with something as with a sponge immersed in water.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Sprinkling or pouring of water</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The ritual itself is usually carried out in the Church and is often contained within or celebrated adjacent to the main form of Sunday worship. The majority of baptisms celebrated in the <strong>Anglican and Catholic</strong> branches of Christianity involve the sprinkling or pouring of water on the head of the child. In <strong>Orthodox Churches</strong> the child is <strong>immersed</strong> briefly in water on three occasions while adults who are baptised in Churches such as Baptist and Pentecostal Churches are often fully immersed in water.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Various aspects</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Across the different denominations of Christianity there are a variety of aspects included in the ritual of baptism. The core elements, shared across the spectrum of Christian practice are the <strong>baptism with water</strong> and the <strong>profession of faith</strong> by or on behalf of the person being baptised.</p>
			<p>The following outlines of a number of rites of baptism from Christian denominations shows some of the other features which are often included in the rite.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>Anglican Sacrament of Baptism</h2>
		<div class="content2">		
		  <div class="footnote"><p /></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The following elements are included in the most <strong>simple rite</strong> of baptism. Other rites of baptism in the Anglican Church incorporate the rite of Confirmation and/or the rite of Holy Communion.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Rite outlined</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The rite begins with a gathering hymn, psalm or anthem. The Priest or Minister then greets and welcomes the congregation. The Collect of the Day is then prayed, followed by the lessons from the Scriptures. A sermon is preached which is then followed by the presentation and examination of the candidates. After this the Baptismal Covenant is prayed and prayers are offered for the candidates. Prayers of thanksgiving and blessing are then prayed over the water and prayers of consecration are prayed over the oils of Chrism. These prayers are followed by the Baptism, the Lord's prayer and a concluding prayer.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>Catholic Sacrament of Baptism</h2>
		<div class="content2">		  
		  <div class="footnote"><p /></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The following outline is the most <strong>simple form</strong> of baptism used in the Catholic Church. Baptism is often incorporated into the celebration of the Eucharist and in particular the celebration of the Easter Vigil.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Rite outlined</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The rite begins with a welcome and greeting from the Priest or Deacon. This is followed by a questioning of the parents and God parents to confirm their wish for baptism. After this the Priest or Deacon and the parents and God parents trace the sign of the cross on the child's forehead.</p>
			<p>The liturgy of the word follows. This includes readings from the bible and a homily from the Priest or Deacon. The homily is followed by the rite of exorcism and the anointing with oil. The waters of the baptismal font are then blessed and those present make a profession of faith, including a renunciation of sin. The Baptism follows, usually involving a pouring of water on the baby's head. The child is then clothed in a white baptismal garment and the parents and God parents receive a baptismal candle.</p>
			<p>The reception of the candle is followed by the ancient prayer of Ephphatha where the Priest or Deacon prays that the child's ears will be open to receive the word of God and that their mouth will be open to proclaim the Gospel. The Our Father is then prayed followed by a final blessing.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>Orthodox Sacrament of Baptism</h2>
		<div class="content2">		  
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Orthodox initiation rite</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The Orthodox Churches celebrate the sacrament of Baptism within a wider rite of initiation which also includes <strong>Chrismation</strong> (anointing) and <strong>Eucharist</strong>. The baptism involves immersing the child three times in the baptismal font. Full immersion is used rather than sprinkling or pouring of water. The triple immersion parallels the belief in the Trinity and the prayers coinciding with the immersion invoke the Father, Son and Spirit.</p>
			<p>The baptism is followed immediately by the anointing of the body with oils and the proclamation of the seal of the Holy Spirit. This is known as Chrismation. The child then receives Eucharist immediately after through a small piece of the bread and a few drops of the wine.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>Adult Baptism - Believer Baptism</h2>
		<div class="content2">		  
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Baptism of adults</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>All Christian denominations which practice baptism incorporate a rite for the baptism of adults. Among the Anglican, Catholic and Orthodox Churches the majority of people are baptised as children, however, among some other Protestant Churches infant baptism is not practiced at all. These Churches believe that baptism should be conferred only after a person has made a <strong>conscious decision</strong> to believe in Jesus Christ. Thus these Churches, such as the <strong>Baptist Church</strong>, and most <strong>Pentecostal Churches</strong> such as Assemblies of God, practice adult baptism, also known as <strong>believer baptism</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Baptism in the Spirit</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Churches which exclusively practice adult or believer baptism generally do not accept the validity of an <strong>infant baptism</strong> in another Christian denomination and usually require a <strong>second baptism</strong> or a <strong>confirmation of baptism</strong> sometimes referred to as baptism in the Spirit.</p>
			<p>Baptism is regarded as an <strong>ordinance in Baptist Churches</strong>. This means that it is something that has been ordered or required of them by Jesus as indicated in the bible.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Baptist tradition</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>In the Baptist tradition, believer baptism would normally be held as part of the <strong>Sunday worship</strong> service. Most Baptist Churches are designed with a baptismal area to allow for the <strong>full immersion</strong> of believers. This is usually at the front of the Church and adjacent to enclosed areas to allow those being baptised to prepare by dressing in a baptismal garment and also to change from the wet garments after the baptism.</p>
			<p>The Baptist service often includes a <strong>testimony</strong> by the person being baptised who publicly declares their <strong>faith in Jesus</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="footnote"><p>Pentecostal Churches</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>In Pentecostal Churches there are few set patterns or rites, however, baptism is usually done through <strong>full immersion</strong> and many Pentecostal groups will carry out baptisms in <strong>public places</strong> such as beaches, rivers and lakes where full immersion can be practiced. The may also decide to use a swimming pool for the rite.</p>
