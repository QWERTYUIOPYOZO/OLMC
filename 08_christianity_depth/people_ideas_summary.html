		<h3>Influencing Theology Study/Training</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
		  <li>Less than 20 years ago it was still possible to take an entire course in theology in most reputable institutions without making any study of feminist theology.</li>
          <li>Today courses in feminist theology are considered mainstream in all but the most conservative institutions.</li> 
          <li>Feminist theology has also impacted significantly on most other theological disciplines such as Ecclesiology, Christology and Liturgy.</li> 
          <li>In particular, Fiorenza's 'hermeneutics of suspicion' has had a significant influence on theological studies.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Challenging the patriarchal customs in most Christian denominations</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Whilst neither Catholic nor Orthodox denominations allow the ordination of women, certain changes have occurred in these denominations.</li> 
          <li>For example, women are able (with the permission of the Pastor) to act in a number of ministries in the Catholic Church (lector, cantor, Eucharistic minister, altar server)</li> 
          <li>Most Protestant denominations allow for the ordination of women though there is still an imbalance and some resistance to the appointment of women to lead congregations.</li> 		
		</ul>
		<h3>Awareness Raising</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Feminist theology has successfully and extensively placed feminist issues in the forefront of public debate.</li> 
          <li>The Catholic Church in Australia recently held a comprehensive public enquiry into the participation of women in the Catholic Church in Australia. </li>
          <li>The Synod of the Anglican Church in Australia has for nearly twenty debated the issue of the ordination of women before reaching agreement.</li>
          <li>Among many Protestant Churches the issue of ordination were resolved decades ago, but the role of awareness raising remains. Despite the lack of formal barriers, many Protestant congregations remain reluctant to appoint female ministers.	</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Inclusive Language</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>Most of the language relating to God and the community of Christians remains gender exclusive. This is particularly true of the bible and of liturgical rites of most Christian Churches. Feminist theologians regard this as unacceptable.</li>
          <li>In recent years attempts have been made to compile inclusive language lectionaries as well as inclusive language hymns and prayers.</li> 
          <li>As with most other issues, Protestant Churches have made this transition much faster than the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.</li>
          <li>The liturgy of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches remain in gender exclusive language as does the lectionary.</li>		
		</ul>
		<h3>Models of Divinity</h3>
		<ul class="summary_points">
          <li>A considerable amount of theological literature in recent times has dealt with issues of overcoming predominating male images of God. Feminist theologians have highlighted alternative biblical images of life bearer, nurturer and sustainer.</li> 
          <li>Frequently now among liberal and progressive groups of Christians there is a willingness to search for and reflect on such images. </li>
          <li>Among conservative Christians there is less willingness to do so.</li>
