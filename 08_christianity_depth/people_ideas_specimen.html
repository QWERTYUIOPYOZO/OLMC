Although it has not had complete success in these areas, feminist theology has, nevertheless, made significant progress in a number of important areas.</p>
        <p>Feminist theologians have made detailed study of the biblical tradition of Christianity which has provided a basis for discussion about the role of women in the Christian Churches.

		<h2>Sample Response</h2>
		<p><strong>Question 2 - Christianity (20 marks)</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Describe the contribution and analyse the effect of ONE significant person or school or thought on Christianity</strong></p>
		<p>One of the most significant movements to influence the development and expression of twentieth century 
		  Christianity is feminist theology. Feminist theology has been influential in assisting women obtain a 
		  more meaningful access to the Church, by advocating the need for more religious rights for women in the 
		  Church. The widespread influence of feminist theology in raising awareness of the gender inequalities 
		  within the Church is evident in that various denominations have attempted to redress some of the 
		  patriarchal customs in the Church by using inclusive language and alternative models of divinity.</p> 
		<p>One pivotal player in the feminist theology movement is Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza. Fiorenza's most 
		  significant contribution, the hermeneutic of suspicion, has effectively revolutionized the understanding 
		  and expression of Christianity in biblical studies. However, the full effect and importance of feminist 
		  theology is difficult to gauge firstly because the work of feminist theologians is still continuing and 
		  secondly because the full force of this movement is still largely restricted to specialist theological 
		  circles. Furthermore, the influence of feminist theology upon the development and expression of 
		  Christianity is restricted largely to liberal Christians across a spectrum of different denominations. 
		  Conservative Christians across various denominations are less aware of the work of feminist theologians 
		  such as Fiorenza, and disapprove of the way feminist theologians construct meaning from the Bible using 
		  hermeneutics.</p>
		<p>The first area where the influence of feminist theology upon the development and expression of 
		  Christianity can be seen in the way it feminist theology has altered theological study and training. 
		  A few decades ago it was possible to undertake an entire course in theology at a reputable institution 
		  without making any study of feminist theology. This was because gender issues in Biblical studies were 
		  at best fringe issues.</p>
		<p>The efforts of feminist theologians like biblical scholar Elisabeth Schussler 
		  Fiorenza has meant that today feminist theology is a part of most mainstream courses in most theology 
		  institutions. As a consequence of this, a broader understanding of Christianity beyond the andocentric 
		  expression of the Bible will inevitably become more prevalent. Admittedly, this open-minded approach to 
		  the understanding of the Bible is still largely restricted to theological and professional circles, 
		  however, over time this perspective will filter down into the grass root levels. This enlightened 
		  perspective will, and has already begun to alter the expression of Christianity amongst the people.</p> 
		<p>This gradual movement is the product of efforts from people like Fiorenza. Her most notable contribution 
		  to Biblical studies is her classic 'In Memory of Her' (1983) where she introduces the groundbreaking 
		  concept of the hermeneutic of expression. The basic premise of the hermeneutic of suspicion is that 
		  whenever texts only record the actions of men or portray women in a negative light, one needs to be 
		  suspicious and call upon greater life experience which demonstrates that this androcentrism is not a 
		  portrayal of reality.</p>
		<p>This tool has effectively led to an overhaul of the manner in which theological 
		  education generally, and Biblical studies in particular are carried out. This alternative expression 
		  and understanding of Christianity is beginning to have a widespread effect upon the development of 
		  Christianity at grass root levels. This is evident in the way her work is used in the Studies of 
		  Religion Course.</p>
		<p>Feminist theology has also had a significant impact on other theological disciplines 
		  outside of the immediate area of biblical studies, such as Christology, Ecclesiology, and Liturgy. The 
		  nature of Fiorenza's work, and that of feminist theology in general, means that it is not universally 
		  acclaimed by all denominations. Its effect is largely restricted to liberal Christians and mostly in 
		  theological circles. Conservative Christians would be less accepting of Fiorenza's work for example, 
		  because she attempts to reconstruct Christian history, which many traditionalists believe is 
		  inappropriate considering the sacred nature of the New Testament.</p>
		<p>The second area where feminist theology has influenced the development and expression of Christianity 
		  is the way they gradually overcome patriarchal customs in most Christian denominations by challenging 
		  the current orthodoxy.</p>
		<p>This concern manifests itself most clearly with regards to the ordination of 
		  women. Feminist theologians have been successful in bringing this contentious topic to the forefront 
		  of public debate. However, there have been varying levels of success with regards to the formal 
		  acknowledgement of the role of women in the Church by ordaining women. The Catholic and Orthodox 
		  Churches have maintained hardline opposition to this practical recognition of women's equality. In 
		  fact statements made by Pope John Paul II seem to rule out the possibility of women being ordained at 
		  all. Women, however, are allowed to act in a number of ministries in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches 
		  such as lector, cantor, Eucharistic minister and altar server.</p>
		<p>Feminist theologians, by comparison, 
		  have had a greater transformative role in the development of the Protestant Church. At an official 
		  level, most Protestant denominations allow the ordination of women. This success, however, is tempered 
		  by the fact that there is still a significant gender imbalance in the number of men ordained compared 
		  to the number of women who have been ordained. This imbalance is partially the result of resistance 
		  within Protestant congregations to having women lead congregations. Nevertheless, the fact that at an 
		  official level most Protestant denominations allow for the ordination of women suggests that the 
		  arguments put forward by feminist theology have had some influence.</p>
		<p>Feminist theologians argue that 
		  the ordination of women is important for symbolic and practical reasons. On a symbolic level, the 
		  ordained person stands as the representative of Christ. On a practical level, the ordained person 
		  has significant decision making authority in the community. Fiorenza adopts an even more radical 
		  stance in arguing that the ordination of women is not an end in itself, that is, it is not the 
		  ultimate goal because the ordination of women would simply perpetuate the inequalities which exist 
		  in the Church. Rather she argues it is a step towards the radical overhaul of the current hierarchical 
		  model of ministry and towards a consensual model known as the Discipleship of Equals. Fiorenza 
		  admits that such a vision is not feasible in the near future. Nevertheless, Fiorenza reminds us that 
		  the new model is unlikely to be achieved unless women are included in the present model. Some 
		  liberationists and feminists disapprove of this stance by labelling her as a radical extremist. 
		  Fiorenza has also been criticised for her decision to stay in the Catholic Church while it practices 
		  the exclusion of women.</p>
		<p>The third area which demonstrates the influence of feminist theology upon the development and 
		  expression of Christianity is the awareness raising campaign which places the issue of gender 
		  inequalities in the forefront of public debate.</p>
		<p>This paves the way for incremental changes to the 
		  expression and development of Christianity. Feminist theology has successfully and extensively put 
		  forward these issues for debate and subsequently changes have occurred within the community at grass 
		  root levels even though such changes do not always flow into an official Church policy. The fact that 
		  the Catholic Church recently held a public enquiry into the participation of women in the Church is 
		  an indication of a degree of success in awareness raising. The Synod of the Anglican in Australia has 
		  debated the issue of the ordination of women finally reaching agreement despite the opposition of the 
		  Diocese of Sydney.</p>
		<p>Feminist theology has been influential in bringing about not only structural changes to the expression 
		  of Christianity, for example with the ordination of women, but also changes to the way individuals 
		  reflect upon their faith. Feminist theologians stress that the use of gender inclusive language is 
		  an important way to raise awareness of the gender inequalities which exist within the Church. This is 
		  because feminist theologians have shown that the androcentric and gender exclusive nature of language 
		  used to refer to God and the community of Christ is unacceptable. As a result of this many communities 
		  have made a considerable effort to rephrase the words of liturgy into gender inclusive language so that 
		  language becomes part of an active engagement and reflection upon faith.</p>
		<p>This attempt by feminist 
		  theologians has had varying levels of success. The Uniting Church for example, has adopted inclusive 
		  language lectionaries. The Catholic Church on the other hand has maintained the use of gender exclusive 
		  language in the liturgy at an official level. But despite the absence of formal change some Catholic 
		  communities use an inclusive language text for liturgy.</p>
		<p>The second way in which feminist theology has 
		  been influential in altering the understanding and subsequent expression of Christianity is by proposing 
		  alternative models of divinity. Feminist theologians argue that God cannot legitimately be referred to 
		  as being exclusively male. This highlights the inherently patriarchal nature of expression within 
		  Christianity. Some Christians are more willing to accept this suggestion than others. For example, 
		  liberal and progressive Christian groups are more likely to incorporate the feminine images of God 
		  found in the Wisdom literature of the Hebrew Scriptures than conservative Christian groups.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, it can be seen that feminist theology has been one of the most influential movements 
		  to affect the development and expression of twentieth century Christianity. Feminist theology has 
		  assisted in securing greater religious rights for women in the church by influencing theological 
		  study, overcoming patriarchal customs in some denominations and raising awareness through the use 
		  of gender inclusive language and alternative models of divinity.</p>
		<p>Whilst it is safe to say that the 
		  full influence of feminist theology is difficult to gauge because of the relatively modern nature of 
		  the movement, the influence of feminist theology does vary across the different denominations. The 
		  work of feminist theology in general, and Fiorenza in particular, the latter who is arguably the most 
		  influential feminist theologian in the twentieth century is widely acclaimed by progressive Christians 
		  across a range of denominations. The influence of feminist theology is restricted in conservative 
		  circles, firstly because many conservative Christians in different denominations would not be aware 
		  of the work of feminist theologians such as Fiorenza, and secondly even if they did, would disprove 
		  of the way in which it questions the traditional orthodoxy.</p>
	    <h2>Sample Response</h2>
		<p><strong>Analyse the impact of ONE significant person OR school of thought and their contribution to the development of ONE religious tradition (20 marks)</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Introduction (231 words)</strong></p>
		<p>In contemporary Christian experience one of the most significant and influential movements is the feminist movement, which is aimed at securing greater religious rights for women in the Church. This would allow for a more meaningful participation of women in the Church. Whilst it is difficult to accurately assess the impact of feminist theology on the development of Christianity because of the relatively modern nature of the movement, it is clear that it has had a profound impact on the Christian tradition across a range of denominations. Liberal Christians in different denominations are often more supportive and willing to adopt the suggestions made by feminist theologians. Conservative Christians however, disapprove of proposals like the ordination of women and other attempts to move outside the traditional orthodoxy.</p>
		<p>In twentieth century feminist theology, few theologians could claim the extent of influence that Elisabeth Schlusser Fiorenza has had. Fiorenza's greatest contribution to feminist theology is the hermeneutic of suspicion, a tool, which has effectively revolutionized Biblical studies. However, Fiorenza's work has yet to infiltrate into grass root levels.</p>
		<p>The role and importance of feminist theology can be seen in five key areas.</p>
		<p>The influence of feminist theology on theological study and training, their attempts to overcome patriarchal customs in most Christian denominations, their role in raising awareness of gender inequalities  in the Church, and their encouragement of inclusive language and alternative models of divinity.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 1 - Influencing theological study and training (300 words)</strong></p>
		<p>Begin with stating how a less than a few decades ago gender issues in biblical studies were, at best, fringe issues. Then explain how the efforts of feminist theologians such as Elisabeth Schlusser Fiorenza, has resulted in the fact that today feminist theology is part of most mainstream courses in most theological institutions. Include in this a brief explanation of the hermeneutic of suspicion and stress its impact on the development of Christianity.</p>
		<p>Evaluate the impact of this contribution by stressing how the efforts of feminist theology in general, and Fiorenza in particular, are still largely restricted to specialist theological circles, but how their contribution is slowly seeping into grass root levels.</p>
		<p>In this evaluation you should include a brief explanation of the different denominational responses towards the work of feminist theology by using Fiorenza as an example to highlight the greater response to her work. You should also briefly explain why the different denominations including different feminist strands within them respond differently to the work of feminist theologians as a direct link to "analyse the impact".</p>
		<p><strong>Section 2 - Challenging and gradually overcoming patriarchal customs in most Christian denominations (300 words)</strong></p>
		<p>Begin by showing how the ordination of women is an example of the attempt to overcome the patriarchal customs in most Christian denominations. Briefly summarise why feminist theologians regard the ordination of women as a critical issue and relate this to their contribution and development of Christianity.</p>
		<p>Analyse the extent of their impact by evaluating whether the different denominations allow the ordination of women. If this is not the case, give a brief statement of what role women are allowed to play in that congregation as a way of qualifying your statement. Show the relationship between the ordination of women and the development of Christianity and draw out the implications of feminist theology on this development.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 3 - Awareness raising (150 words)</strong></p>
		<p>Explain why raising awareness of the gender inequalities in the Church is important to the development of Christianity. Weigh up the extent of their impact by saying that this method provides incremental change rather than a radical overhaul of the current model.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 4 - Inclusive Language (200 words)</strong></p>
		<p>Discuss the contribution of feminist theology to the way it influences the mindset of individuals within that tradition. Provide a brief explanation of why feminist theologians argue that gender inclusive language is important.</p>
		<p>Evaluate whether feminist theology has been successful in encouraging the use of gender inclusive language. Do this by showing how some Christian denominations such as the Uniting Church are more willing to adopt inclusive language lectionaries than the Catholic Church for example. Then qualify this statement by showing how changes are being made at grass root levels, despite the lack of policy change at an official level.</p>
		<p><strong>Section 5 - Alternative Models of Divinity (150 words)</strong></p>
		<p>Show the connection between the last Section and this Section, in that the use of language and alternative models of divinity are both methods of raising awareness. Briefly explain why alternative models of divinity are important. Link this to the development of how Christianity is expressed by individuals.</p>
		<p>Evaluate whether feminist theologians have been successful in advocating the use of alternative models of divinity by examining the response of the different denominations towards this issue.</p>
		<p><strong>Conclusion (169 words)</strong></p>
		<p>Therefore, it can be seen that feminist theology has played a significant role on the development and growth of Christianity, by securing greater religious rights for women in the Church. The influence of feminist theology can be seen most evidently in the areas of theological study, in overcoming patriarchal customs, and awareness raising through the use of inclusive language and alternative models of divinity.</p>
		<p>The influence of feminist theology, of which Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza was a pivotal player, varies across the different denominations. Fiorenza's work in particular and that of feminist theology in general is widely acclaimed, especially among more progressive Christians across a range of denominations. It is unlikely that many conservative Christians would approve of her work if they were familiar with it. They would be critical of her work given that she discredits traditional approaches to sacred texts. Nevertheless, having said that is difficult to accurately gauge the extent of the influence by feminist theologians because their work is ongoing.</p>
