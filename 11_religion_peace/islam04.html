		<h2>Contribution of Islam to World Peace</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>Misconception</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>While Islam is essentially a religion of peace and true Muslims are peace loving people, there remains, nevertheless, an unfortunate misconception about the nature of Islam and its followers.</p>
			<p>The sources of this misconception are varied. Firstly, the misconception stems from a <strong>prejudice arising from the fear of the unknown</strong>. For many people in Australia, Islam is a relatively unknown religion. Because there are only a small number of Muslims in Australia, few non Muslim Australians have had the opportunity of getting to know Australian Muslims and rely on secondary sources of information to inform their views on Muslims and Islam in Australia. There is an unavoidable tendency to hold prejudices against people and groups who are not well known and understood in a community.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Political conflicts</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The second source of misconception stems from the <strong>political conflicts</strong> that have existed in the Middle East in recent decades and particularly through the conflicts between Western interests and those of Middle Eastern countries. People in countries such as Australia feel uneasy when there is conflict around Western interests and the use of <strong>terrorist tactics</strong> by some groups has heightened this sense of unease. Unfortunately, many people are not able to differentiate between the <strong>political interests</strong> of some Middle Eastern countries and the <strong>religious interests</strong> of Islam. Further the activities of some extremists who claim to be acting in the name of Islam tend to reinforce the misconception that Islam is in some way responsible for the unrest.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Media</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>A third source of misconception is the fact that most people in Australia have the <strong>media as their main source of information</strong> regarding Islam.  Unfortunately, media organisations in Australia have been only too willing to <strong>promote misconceptions and stereotypes</strong> in order to create a greater interest in their product. Recent years have shown that <strong>fear and uncertainty</strong> is a great motivator in Australian society and media organisations have traded enthusiastically on this fact. Thus it serves their purposes to demonise certain members of the community in order to foster this sense of unease. The fact that so many Australians rely on the media for their information and the media's propensity to <strong>stereotype Muslims</strong> as terrorists has contributed greatly to the misconception of Islam.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Work for peace</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>In the light of this prevailing misconception it is very difficult for Muslims to play a <strong>constructive role in the work for world peace</strong>.  There are indeed many Muslim organisations and individual Muslims who are undertaking important work for peace, however, in Australia it is difficult for such work to be recognised and supported because of the negativity felt towards Muslims and the strength of the misconceptions held in the community.</p>
			<p>Muslim groups in Australia have found that the most constructive way they can be involved in the peace process is to provide opportunities for people in the Australian community to become <strong>more familiar with Muslim values and beliefs</strong>.</p>
			<p>Given that a great deal of present conflict stems from a misunderstanding of Islam, such initiatives have profound significance in terms of addressing the underlying causes of conflict.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Partnerships</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Muslims has also taken active roles in <strong>partnerships with other religious organisations</strong> in the search for peace. In particular, Muslims work closely with <strong>Jewish and Christian</strong> organisations as these three monotheistic religions have a great deal in common and are able to work together readily. This is especially the case in working of peace which is a <strong>core value</strong> of each of these religions.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Repudiation of terrorism</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Most Muslim organisations in Western Countries such as Australia include statements on their <strong>websites</strong> which unequivocally state their <strong>opposition to the terrorist activities</strong> of extremist groups.</p>
			<p>For example, the <strong>NSW Islamic Council</strong> Website included the following repudiation of violence in the aftermath of the London bombings of 2005.</p>
			<p>"We firmly hold the view that these killings and atrocities have absolutely <strong>no sanction in Islam</strong>, nor is there any justification whatsoever in our noble religion for taking innocent life.</p>
			<p>The Qur'an clearly declares that killing an innocent person is tantamount to killing all humanity and, similarly, saving a single life is as if one has saved the life of all humanity. (The Qur'an, Al-Maidah 5:32).</p>
			<p>No Australian should ever fear our local Muslim community, which remains today an integral part of our shared Australian society.</p>
			<p>The culture of suicide bombings or similar acts of terrorism known and feared elsewhere in the world does not exist in Australia, has no support from the leadership of the Islamic community in Australia, and would <strong>never be endorsed</strong> in any way, shape or form by Islamic values."</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Joint statements</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Muslim leaders have also contributed to joint statements and programs with leaders of <strong>other religious faiths to condemn violence</strong> and work for peace. Because of the relatively small Muslim population in Australia these actions have a largely <strong>symbolic value</strong>, however, they are important steps in educating the wider Australian community as to the true nature of Islam.</p>
			<p>Throughout the world there are a number of countries which have predominantly Muslim populations and in all of these there are organisations and activists who are prominent in their work for peace.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Indonesia</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>One of the largest Muslim populations in the world is found in Indonesia. In Indonesia the <strong>conflict in the Aceh province</strong> has been a serious concern over recent years. Nurdin Rahman is a <strong>Muslim peace activist</strong> who has worked tirelessly during the conflict to help the rival parties reach a peaceful settlement. Negotiations have taken place in Geneva over the last four years which have resulted in a <strong>peace agreement</strong> being reached in 2005. Nurdin Rahman now believes it is important for countries such as Australia to provide <strong>aid to community organisations</strong> in Aceh rather than to the Indonesian military. Rahman argues that the military have been responsible for so many killings and atrocities in the province that Achenese people will not find it easy to trust them now that peace has been achieved.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Middle East</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Many of the larger Muslim populations of the world are found in the Middle East and sadly many of these have experienced <strong>decades of ongoing conflict</strong>. The Palestinian state has been one of the worst affected by violence with constant conflict existing between the <strong>Palestinians and the State of Israel</strong>.</p>
			<p>In the midst of the violence, various <strong>Muslim organisations have continued to work for peace</strong>.  One such organisation is the Israeli-Palestinian Relations Committee of the Israeli & Palestinian Bereaved Families for Peace, also known as the Family Circle or the Families' Forum. This is a gathering of Palestinians and Israelis who've lost family members due to the occupation and the severe cycle of violence. They work towards an end to the occupation and <strong>peaceful reconciliation</strong> between warring sides in the conflict.</p>
			<p>Their work shows the power of engaging with those who have <strong>suffered loss</strong> due to the conflict. They also point out the important relationship between justice and peace, acknowledging that there will never be <strong>lasting peace</strong> in the region without a <strong>just settlement</strong> of the dispute.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>India</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Another area in which the bereaved are taking action is in the Kashmir region to the north of India. India has one of the largest and most <strong>rapidly growing Muslim populations</strong> in the world. In this area, the <strong>South Asia Forum for Human Rights</strong> has developed a number of important programs including the program of "Regional Dialogues of Women Building Peace". Acknowledging that women are so often the innocent victims of conflict the dialogues seek to <strong>engage women in partnerships</strong> that will begin to breakdown the sources of the conflict.</p>
			<p>A conference sponsored in Kathmandu in 2001 proposed a number of <strong>critical questions</strong> which have become the basis for action. Could Kashmiri Pandit (Hindu) and Kashmiri Muslim women find a common language born of pain and grief to begin a dialogue reaching beyond the blaming syndrome towards empathetic mutual understanding? Could women forge a coalition on the basis of cross cutting identities challenging polarised ethnic constructs? That is, beyond their common identity as victims, do these women have the potential to mobilize as a constituency for peace?</p>
			<p>Examples such as these from Indonesia, the Middle East and India indicate some of the ways that Muslims are working for peace in areas where they are significant in number. These actions go hand in hand with the awareness raising work undertaken in countries like Australia where their number are small.</p>
