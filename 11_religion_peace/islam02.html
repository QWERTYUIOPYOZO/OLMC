		<h2>Principal teachings about peace in Islam</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>Centrality of peace</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The religion of Islam is based on the notion of peace as an essential element. <strong>The word "Islam"</strong> itself comes from the Arabic <strong>words for peace selm and salam</strong>. The traditional Muslim greeting "As-Salamu-Alaykum" means peace be with you.</p>
			<p>The opening verse of the Qur'an  expresses an important element of the Muslim understanding of peace. " In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most compassionate." This tone continues in many places throughout the revealed text. This verse is repeated in the Qur'an no less than 114 times.  Included among the Qur'anic <strong>names for Allah is "As Salaam" which means peace</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Paths of peace</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The Qur'an refers to <strong>Islam as 'the paths of peace'</strong> (5:16). It describes reconciliation as a basic stance (4:128) and states that <strong>Allah abhors disturbance of the peace</strong>. (2:205) Islam regards the mission of the Prophet Muhammad as one of <strong>peace and mercy</strong> to humankind. (21:107)</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Permitted use of force</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>It is therefore clear that the principal teachings of Islam strongly <strong>advocate peace</strong>. However, there are also clear teachings in Islam which <strong>permit the use of force in certain situations</strong>.</p> 
            <p>Unfortunately, the teachings of Islam on the use of force have <strong>frequently been misrepresented</strong> both by extremist elements claiming to be Muslim and others outside the Muslim tradition who seek to portray all Muslims as extremists.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Jihad misrepresented</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The concept of "<strong>Jihad</strong>" in Islam is very often the <strong>source of the misrepresentation</strong>.  Jihad is a central teaching of Islam but is not, as many believe, synonymous for war. It is not even the term used in the Qur'an to refer to war When Qur'an refers to war or fighting it uses the word "qital" and not jihad.</p>
			<p>Jihad literally means to <strong>strive or to struggle</strong>. In its proper usage it refers mostly to the essential struggle in <strong>overcoming obstacles to submission to Allah</strong>. It can, and <strong>does also refer to the military struggle</strong> to achieve religious freedom for Muslims and the protection of Muslim values, however, the use of force is always a last resort and war of aggression is not permitted Islam.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Peace fundamental aim of Islam</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>A close analysis of Islamic texts and the history of Islam demonstrate clearly that <strong>peace is the fundamental aim of Islam</strong>. Wars can be fought, however, to defend against acts of aggression and overcome oppression, but only as the last resort.  For Muslims <strong>war is not a way to advance ideology or extend political power and influence</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Peace in Islam</strong> does not just mean the absence of war, but <strong>extends to the absence of oppression and tyranny</strong>. For Muslims, <strong>true peace can only exist where there is justice</strong>. Therefore, Islam justifies war against oppressive regimes that prevent people from living in freedom and upholding their religious beliefs and practices. It does not, however, justify war against non-Muslim people for the purposes of forcefully spreading the influence of Islam.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>dar al Islam and dar al Harb</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The idea that Islam supports the use of force in order to propagate itself stems largely from doctrines that were developed during the classical period of Islamic scholarship. Including in this period of scholarship was a doctrine that <strong>divided the world into two domains</strong>. These two domains were broadly understood as the areas or <strong>regions under the influence of Islam "dar al lslam"</strong> and "<strong>dar al Harb", the regions not under the influence of Islam</strong> or Islamic law. Some scholars have regarded the second region "dar al Harb" as a zone of struggle or conflict which Muslims should seek to bring under Islamic influence.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Muslim influence</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The division of the world into these two domains and the notion that Muslims ought to <strong>strive to bring "dar al Harb" under Islamic influence</strong> is the idea that is <strong>used by Muslim extremists</strong> to promote their ideology of an aggressive propagation of Islam. Some such extremists use the term "jihad" to describe their campaigns of violence. Thus the term "<strong>jihad</strong>" has, in the minds of many, come to be <strong>associated with the idea of a holy war</strong> against all who do not embrace Islam.</p>
			<p>Such extremist views, however, are clearly <strong>matters of ideology</strong> rather than an authentic vision of Islam and there is no doubt that <strong>authentic Islam abhors the use of force and seeks to promote peace</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Muslim pacifism</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>In the early years of Islam, under persistent threats of persecution and harassment <strong>Muslims adopted a pacifist stance in Makkah</strong>. Even when this pacifism was abandoned during the time in Madinah, <strong>force was only used in response to those who attacked the Muslims</strong>. This permission to use force is expressed in the Qur'an "to those against whom war is made, permission to fight is given" (22:39)</p>
			<p>In Madinah, the Muslims <strong>remained at peace with the Jews</strong> who lived in the city. Muhammad forged an alliance of cooperation and friendship with the Jews which assured them of their freedom of religion as well as their security in the Muslim world.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Conflict with Byzantium</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The notion of the two domains "dar al lslam" and "dar al Harb" did not arise until sometime later during a period of <strong>conflict between Islam and the Byzantine empire</strong>. It is understandable during such conflicts that extremist attitudes develop towards the other. Previously <strong>peaceful relations</strong> had existed between the <strong>Islamic world and the Christian realm of Abyssinia</strong>.</p>
			<p>Muslim scholars had no notion of "dar al lslam" and "dar al Harb" until later periods when conflict prevailed. Thus this sense of polarisation between Muslims and non Muslims is not a reflection of the authentic teaching of Islam but a response to a period of conflict. <strong>Extremists</strong> seeking to use the name of Islam to further their ideologies often <strong>call upon this division</strong> as a basis for their campaign, however, such hostility and division is <strong>not representative of Islam</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Use of Qur'an by extremists</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The <strong>Qur'an</strong> has also been <strong>used to provide support for extremists in their campaigns</strong>. Surahs such as 2:193 at <strong>face value</strong> suggest an endorsement of a campaign to force others to submit to Islam. "And fight them on until there is no more Fitnah and religion should be only for Allah. (2:193).</p>
			<p>However, <strong>in context</strong> this surah clearly refers to a <strong>defence of Islam</strong> in the face of aggression by others. "Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not commit aggression, for Allah loves not aggressors." (2:190)  .  but if they cease, let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression. (2:193)</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Aggression towards non Muslims</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Another section of the Qur'an <strong>seems to invite aggression</strong> towards non Muslims "slay the mushrikin wherever you find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem; but if they repent, and establish Salat and pay Zakat, then open the way for them" (9:5). Yet <strong>the context</strong> is clearly a reference to the non Muslims at the time of Muhammad who were <strong>actively plotting against the Muslims in Madinah</strong>.</p>
			<p>Therefore, while this surah is <strong>not an endorsement of hostility towards non Muslims</strong> it does contain the basis for the Muslim support of a <strong>pre-emptive strike</strong> where the evidence of an imminent attack is unmistakable.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Permitted use of war</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>In Islam, the permitted use of war is to <strong>establish and assure justice</strong>, and to <strong>overcome oppression and tyranny</strong>. Four situations can be seen where an Islamic state is justified in using force.</p>
			<p>The first situation is to overcome oppression where there is the <strong>denial of religious freedom</strong></p>
			<p>The second situation is when <strong>individual Muslims and their property are under attack</strong> from another group in the community.</p>
			<p>The third situation is where an <strong>Islamic state is invaded by a foreign power</strong>. In this situation, the use of a pre-emptive strike is also permitted if the evidence of an impending attack is unmistakable.</p>
			<p>The fourth situation relates to <strong>law enforcement</strong> where there is a need to <strong>subdue rebellion against legitimate authority</strong> within an Islamic state. This does not refer to opposition to public policy or reasonable protest. Rather it relates to a kind of insurrection which seeks to use violence and force to achieve ideological goals. In this context, the use of force by Muslim authorities is understood as being aimed at the protection of other people and their property.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Force necessary in some situations</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Muslims see the <strong>use of force as necessary in certain contexts</strong>, believing that without the responsible use of force there would be <strong>chaos and the triumph of tyranny</strong> in the community.</p>
            <p>"Had it not been (the Will of) Allah that one set of people is repelled by another, certainly the earth would have been in a state of disorder." (2:251)</p>
			<p>"Had it not been (the Will of) Allah that one set of people is repelled by another, certainly there would have been pulled down monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of Allah is commemorated in abundant measure." (22:40) </p>
