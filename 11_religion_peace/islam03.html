		<h1>Content Description</h1>
		<h2>Guidance for Muslims in achieving inner peace</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>Peace with self and with the world</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>For Muslims, <strong>peace is not a single dimensional</strong> or individual concept. Peace is, first and foremost, to be at rest with one's own desires and ambitions and <strong>having a balance</strong>, which is an internal affair, and then, secondly, to have <strong>peace with the world around</strong>. There is a <strong>reciprocal relationship</strong> between this inner peace and the peace with the wider world. No one can be at peace with themselves until they are also at peace with others. Conversely, it will not be possible to live at peace with others until there is a sense of peace and wellbeing with one's self</p>
			<p>In Islam the <strong>concept of peace is two-fold</strong>. Firstly, to be at <strong>peace with Allah</strong> and then, secondly, to be at <strong>peace with oneself and with the rest of the world</strong>. In Islam the concept of peace is closely related to the idea of <strong>submission</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Submission leads to peace</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The goal of Islam is <strong>submission to Allah</strong> and in this submission peace is found. Muslims understand that <strong>peace is not possible outside of this relationship with Allah</strong>. In submitting to Allah a person finds peace, peace first of all with Allah, then with self and also with others. Submission to the will of Allah is the only means of attaining peace with Allah.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Qur'an sets out paths for peace</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The Qur'an sets out clear paths for Muslims to follow in their desire to <strong>submit to Allah</strong>. The most significant of these are the five pillars or the <strong>pillars of Islam (arkan al-islam).</strong> These activities and beliefs are regarded as foundational for all who follow Islam. Each of the pillars requires both an internal or spiritual commitment together with an outward action or sign.</p>
			<p>By devoutly and sincerely following fulfilling the requirements of the five pillars, Muslims will find themselves living <strong>according to the will of Allah</strong> and as a consequence experience a deep <strong>sense of peace</strong> and wellbeing that can only come through this submission.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Shahada</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The first of the five pillars is a <strong>witness to the oneness of Allah</strong> and the role of the Prophet Muhammad as its messenger. This pillar is known as the shahada which means to bear witness. The shahada is expressed as follows "Ashadu an la ilaha il-allahu wa Muhammadar rasullah". It means "I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah".</p>
			<p>The witness in the shahada is essentially <strong>all that it takes to be considered a Muslim</strong>. It is a declaration that Muslims pray ceaselessly in everyday life. Muslims seek to pray the shahada each morning upon waking and each night before sleeping. The shahada is whispered into the ear of a newly born child. It is part of the call to prayer proclaimed by the muezzin, it forms part of ritual prayer and underpins prayers offered during pilgrimage and at the hour of death of a believer.</p>
			<p>The shahada essentially witnesses to the monotheism of Islam. Its central statement <strong>affirms the oneness of Allah</strong> and expressed in the negative "there is no god but Allah" provides not only an affirmation of the oneness of Allah but also includes a repudiation of anything which falsely claims to be God. The repudiation of anything false includes a repudiation of self and selfishness which frees a Muslim to <strong>worship Allah freely</strong> without the restrictions of egocentrism. This freedom is an integral part of the <strong>quest for inner peace</strong> as a focus on self and selfishness will effectively destroy this peace.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Salat</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The second of the pillars of Islam is the <strong>requirement of ritual prayer</strong> known as "salat". The requirement here is that every Muslim will offer five daily prayers. In addition, prayers are offered on Fridays at noon at the mosque. There are also prayers to be offered on the great festivals and on other significant occasions.</p>
			<p>The ritual prayers of salat play an important role in Islam at a number of different levels. Firstly they are an <strong>act of obedience</strong> to Allah. Secondly they proclaim the oneness and greatness of Allah. The prayers also serve the function of bringing people closer to Allah, they contribute to the <strong>purity of the person</strong> praying, provide strength to carry out the requirements of Islam and forgiveness for transgressions. The purity and strength associated with salat provide important foundations for a <strong>sense of peace and wellbeing</strong></p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Zakat</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The third pillar of Islam is the <strong>requirement of almsgiving</strong> known as "zakat". Zakat operates as a kind of tithe where money is collected from Muslims and given to the poor. It has also been described as a charitable tax.</p>
			<p>The aim of zakat for the one contributing is to purify and cleanse wealth and to allow it to be <strong>free from greed and selfishness</strong>. It helps Muslims to overcome feelings of attachment to money and the wish to cling to it. It affirms that money is for the service of human kind and not for exclusive personal gain. The <strong>freedom from the attachment</strong> of wealth and possessions is considered by Muslims to be an essential element in the quest for inner peace.</p>
			<p>Muslims believe that the things they own; their wealth and possessions, are <strong>not truly their own</strong> but rather in trust to them by Allah. Thus anything they give is understood as simply returning the material goods to their rightful owner. They also believe that it is Allah's choice for people to be rich and poor and that the rich have an obligation to help the poor which goes beyond the notion of charity.</p>
			<p>Wealth and material possessions are understood to be <strong>transient things</strong>. People are born into the world without possessions, they will leave the world without possessions and therefore it is <strong>foolishness to cling to possessions</strong> and even worse to be dominated by them. To maintain close ties to wealth and possession will effectively <strong>undermine the search for inner peace</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Sawm</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The fourth pillar of Islam involves fasting. It refers to <strong>voluntary fasting</strong> and is known as "sawm". The period of fasting is for the <strong>month of Ramadan</strong>. During this period all adult Muslims who are in good health will fast for all the hours of daylight. The month of Ramadan, the ninth month in the Muslim calendar is significant as the tradition teaches that it is the month of the revelation of the Qu'ran to Muhammad.</p>
			<p>While one emphasis of sawm is on the physical denial of the body it also includes important elements relating to the <strong>internal disposition and intention</strong>. The fast will be rendered worthless if the disposition of the person fasting is not as it should be. There is to be a concerted effort to ensure that no evil acts are committed during the period of the fast and also that evil thoughts are also avoided. "If you do not give up telling lies Allah will have no need of your giving up food and drink" (Hadith).</p>
			<p>Sawm has a number of important elements in its observance. It is a primary way of commemorating Ramadan and honouring the occasion of the revelation of the Qu'ran. Secondly it is a time where the hunger of the person fasting brings to mind the reality of poverty and where almsgiving is strongly encouraged. The <strong>self discipline</strong> of fasting is an important <strong>companion to achieving inner peace</strong> as it is one of the ways of putting aside self and selfishness.</p>
			<p>In successfully completing the requirements of fasting, a Muslim learns <strong>self discipline and overcomes degrees of selfishness, greed and laziness</strong>. There is also a strong spiritual element to the fasting. Many Muslims make extra effort in prayer and religious learning during the month of Ramadan. Mosques hold special additional times of prayer known as "tarawih".</p>

          <div class="footnote"><p>Hajj</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The fifth pillar of Islam is the pilgrimage or "hajj". Every devout Muslim male will desire to make the <strong>pilgrimage to Makkah</strong> at least once in their lifetime. For those who live nearby it may be possible to make the pilgrimage on a number of occasions. However, for most Muslims it is a once in a lifetime experience and some need to save for most of their lives in order to perform the hajj.</p>
			<p>The word "hajj" means to embark on a <strong>journey with a purpose</strong>. The purpose is essentially to visit the Ka'bah in Makkah and worship on Mount Arafat. The pilgrimage takes place during the twelfth month of the Muslim calendar "Dhul-Hijjah".</p>
			<p>The physical demands of the Hajj, the organisation required for someone to take part and the material cost are all elements which require sacrifice and dedication. These elements involve <strong>putting aside selfishness in seeking to submit to the will of Allah</strong>. The more perfect the submission to Allah, the more profound the sense of inner peace that will be experienced by the Muslim.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Sufi mysticism</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>In Islam, the mystical movement of <strong>Sufism</strong> has had significant influence on the <strong>quest for inner peace</strong>. Sufi teachings have a strong emphasis on peace in general but most particularly on the attainment of a deep inner peace.</p>
			<p>Sufism teaches that a person travels through <strong>three stations or stages of peace</strong> in their spiritual journey. These stations are a progressive development through the most basic experience of peace to the most profound and complete state.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Three stations</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The first station is known as the <strong>stage of Islam</strong> and it refers to the conscious act of <strong>submission to the will of Allah</strong> such as achieved through the sincere practice of the pillars of Islam. The second station refers to a stage where the peace of Allah has come into the heart of the Muslim and where the <strong>peace of Allah has become internalised</strong>. This second station is <strong>known as Iman</strong>. The third station known as the <strong>stage of Ihsan</strong> is a <strong>transformative stage</strong> where the power of evil is defeated and the Muslim experiences the peace of Allah <strong>free from the entrapments of evil</strong>.</p>
