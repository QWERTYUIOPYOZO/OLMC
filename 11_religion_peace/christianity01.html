		<h1>Content Description</h1>
		<h2>The understanding of peace expressed in the New Testament</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>Normative text for all Christians</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The New Testament is the normative text for all Christians. While there are some differences in the way the New Testament is used and understood among Christian groups, it is, nevertheless, the <strong>principal and foundational source of teaching</strong> for all Christians.</p>
			<p>The New Testament comprises 27 individual books made up of 4 gospels, 21 letters or epistles mostly attributed to the apostle Paul and the Acts of the Apostles and the book of Revelation.</p>
			<p>Among the pages of the New Testament, peace is a frequent and all pervasive theme. Peace is mentioned over <strong>ninety times</strong> in the New Testament literature. It is found in the announcements of the birth of Jesus (Luke 2:14), in the teaching of Jesus (Matthew 5:9), in the life of the early Church communities (Galatians 5:22) and in the vision of the messianic age (Revelation 6:4). Most commonly it is used as a form of greeting and/or blessing. "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (Romans 1:7).</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Underlying value</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>In addition to the specific uses of the term "peace", there are very many other occasions where peace is clearly an underlying value or principle in the message. Peace is <strong>at the heart of Jesus' life and ministry</strong> and accordingly it is a <strong>foundational element</strong> of the Christian communities that seek to follow him.</p>
			<p>The New Testament extols peace as a virtue and identifies it as a <strong>key element of the reign of God</strong>. Jesus himself is known as the <strong>prince of peace</strong> and is regarded as the source of peace. Christians are encouraged to <strong>model their "peacemaking" on his example</strong> and to draw strength and inspiration from his spirit. There are, however, few examples of practical instruction relating to the seeking of peace and the avoidance of conflict. The vast majority of references to peace in the New Testament relate to an inner peace and or a state of peace in interpersonal relationships. Only a small number of instances seem to give guidance to Christians in relation to peace at a global level and the involvement or otherwise of Christians in warfare.</p>

		<h2>The Peace of God</h2>
		<div class="content2">		
          <div class="footnote"><p /></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The letter to the Philippians promises that "the peace of God which is beyond all understanding will guard your hearts and minds, in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 4:7). This promise is given to those who devote themselves to God and make God the centre of their attention and the focus of their energies. It is an example of the <strong>inner peace</strong> that is promised to Christians who live faithfully according to the requirements of the gospel and who place their <strong>faith and trust in God</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>More than an absence of conflict and violence</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>In this sense peace can be understood as a <strong>sense of wellbeing</strong>, <strong>free from anxiety</strong>. It is not merely an absence of conflict and violence but a far deeper notion recognising a profound serenity and sense of wellbeing. The peace of God experienced by followers of Jesus is thought to be a <strong>foretaste of the peace experienced in eternal life</strong> with God.</p>
			<p>Throughout the ministry of Jesus, the notion of peace often <strong>accompanies the forgiveness of sin or an occasion of healing</strong>. (Luke 7:50 & Luke 8:48). Examples such as these confirm the notion that peace is experienced in the <strong>presence of God</strong> and through God's saving activity.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Presence of God</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>In his words to his disciples Jesus <strong>promises peace</strong> as his parting gift. "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you" (John 14:27). Once again peace is clearly associated with God's presence in Jesus and subsequently <strong>in the Spirit</strong> which is to be given to the disciples.</p>
			<p>The early Church communities also reflect the notion of peace being associated with the presence of God through the <strong>gift of the Holy Spirit</strong>. Peace is seen as one of the fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22) and it is regarded in the communities as a sign of God's activity and the fidelity of the Christians to the gospel. It is <strong>contrasted with selfish values</strong> which undermine the gospel. "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace" (Romans 8:6).</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Example of Jesus</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>For Christians to experience the peace of God they must devote themselves to listening to the good news and commit themselves to following the <strong>example of Jesus in his life and ministry</strong>. This brings with it a requirement of prayer and contemplation, of communal life and celebration and of commitment to the welfare of others and to the wider community.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>Peace in Relationships</h2>
		<div class="content2">			
          <div class="footnote"><p>Peace with others</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>"If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all" (Romans 12:18). In this extract from Paul's writings there is a clear understanding of the expectation that Christians <strong>live in peace with others</strong>. However, this statement is tempered by the qualification "so far as it depends on you".  On one hand this is understood as a <strong>requirement to do all</strong> that is within your power to be at peace with others. On the other hand there is a recognition, due to the actions of others, it may not always be possible for this peaceful relationship to exist.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Peacemaking</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The teaching of the New Testament indicates that Christians have opportunities in relationships <strong>to be people of peace</strong> and to work towards harmonious dealings with all people. People are regularly confronted with situations of tension and potential conflict. In many of these situations they have a possibility of escalating or diffusing this tension by their response. The notion of peacemaking in relationships is linked to being able to <strong>diffuse situations of tension</strong> before they escalate and to <strong>create cycles of harmony and reconciliation</strong> rather than support cycles of conflict and violence.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Forgiveness and forbearance</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Christians are encouraged to <strong>forgive one another</strong>, to bear with one another, to act with love towards each other and to <strong>avoid selfish motives</strong> in dealing with each other. These responses in relationships will lead to peace and help avoid the destructive behaviour which often leads to conflict and violence.</p>
			<p>One area of apparent concern in the New Testament communities was to <strong>live peacefully with other members of the Church</strong>. Clearly, it would be a scandal for the ones who preach peace to be unable to live at peace with each other. Accordingly, the writer to the Ephesians calls on Christians to be "diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (Ephesians 4:3).</p>
			<p>In the famous sayings of the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-12) being someone who works for peace is highly praised. The peacemakers are recognised as <strong>God's children</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>War and Peace</h2>
		<div class="content2">			  
          <div class="footnote"><p>Non violence</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>While there is no doubt that peace is considered as a <strong>central value</strong> of the Christian life, the New Testament stops short of giving an unequivocal prohibition of warfare.</p>
			<p>The strongest statements against engaging in warfare come from the preaching of Jesus himself. Most famously in the injunction to "turn the other cheek" (Matthew 6:39), Christians are told <strong>not to retaliate or return violence with violence</strong>.</p>
			<p>Secondly, the Beatitudes provide another statement against warfare with their <strong>praise of the peacemakers</strong>. (Matthew 5:9). Other teachings such as the command to love your neighbour as yourself (Matthew 22:39), the requirement to <strong>love enemies</strong> (Matthew 5:44) and to treat others as you would want to be treated (Luke 6:31) are all indication of the New Testament's support of peace and <strong>opposition to warfare</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Advocate of peace</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Any fair minded reading of the gospels could not avoid the conclusion that Jesus was a strong <strong>advocate of peace</strong> and a staunch <strong>opponent of violence</strong>. It is not surprising, therefore, to learn that until the fourth century Christians on the whole refused to undertake military service and engage in warfare.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Pacifism</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The <strong>pacifist stance</strong> of the Christian communities came to be one of their identifying features and was one of the reasons that they suffered persecution from Roman authorities.</p>
			<p>Despite this clear response of the early Christian Churches there are, nevertheless, some grounds for discussion. The gospels provide accounts of Jesus ministering to the needs of military personnel such as the <strong>Centurion's request</strong> on behalf of his servant (Matthew 8:5-13). Nowhere in this encounter does Jesus question the Centurion's profession. Nor are there any indications in the New Testament letters that soldiers who convert to Christianity must renounce their military service.</p>
			<p>Other issues arise with the account of Jesus expelling the <strong>money changers</strong> from the temple (Mark 11:15-18) and his statement about his mission bringing division not peace (Matthew 10:34). Whatever the intent of these accounts, it is not legitimate to portray them as an endorsement of the use of force or violence and in the context of the wider teaching of the New Testament they do not take away the strength of the message <strong>condoning peace and condemning violence</strong>.</p>
