		<h1>Content Description</h1>
		<h2>Guidance for Christians in achieving inner peace</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p /></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>A study of the New Testament literature reveals an important relationship between an individual's fidelity to the requirements of the gospel and their own sense of peace and wellbeing. In other words, Christians can expect to find inner peace ultimately in and through <strong>living out their vocation</strong> as disciples of Jesus Christ and directing their lives towards the following of his teaching.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Example of Jesus' life</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Jesus himself is regarded as the <strong>bringer of peace</strong> and to live in close relationship to him and his teaching will allow the follower to experience this peace. Jesus' own life is seen as a <strong>model of living in peace</strong> and therefore Christians are encouraged to model their lives on his example in doing so they will be able to find peace.</p>
			<p>The examination of Jesus life and ministry reveals a number of important elements in achieving this <strong>sense of peace and wellbeing</strong>. These elements include Jesus' <strong>integrity and fidelity</strong> to his mission, his balance of <strong>prayer and active ministry</strong> and the <strong>communal nature</strong> of his work.</p>
			<p>A brief reflection on each of these elements will help provide an insight into achieving inner peace.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>Integrity and Fidelity</h2>
		<div class="content2">		
          <div class="footnote"><p>Effect of compromise</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The most basic and fundamental aspect of being at home with oneself and thereby experiencing peace and wellbeing comes from maintaining a <strong>sense of integrity and fidelity</strong> to one's vocation. It would not be possible to achieve inner peace while experiencing turmoil and inner conflict due to <strong>compromising personal values</strong> etc.</p>
			<p>In his life and ministry, Jesus faced various occasions where it would have been expedient to turn his back on his vocation and accept a compromise or succumb to a <strong>temptation of selfishness</strong>. These temptations are essentially about serving one's self or avoiding challenging situations. Jesus' example clearly shows the importance of being <strong>true to the values of the gospel</strong> and not being prepared to accept compromise. Such compromise would inevitably erode a sense of inner peace as it amounts to a lack of integrity and will always result in <strong>inner conflict</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Temptation in the wilderness</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>These types of challenges and temptations can be seen in the accounts of Jesus' temptation in the wilderness before beginning his public ministry (Matthew 4:1-11 & Luke 4:1-13). These temptations offer Jesus an easy way out of challenging circumstances and also encourage him to put himself and his own needs before those of others. To have accepted these offers would have resulted in Jesus' compromising himself and <strong>losing the sense of peace that arises from integrity</strong>.</p>
			<p>By refusing to be tempted he <strong>retains his integrity</strong> and is able to faithfully go about his ministry. This includes the important element of being able to place his life at the service of others. This selflessness is a <strong>liberating quality</strong> which has a significant impact on the capacity to achieve inner peace.</p>
			<p>Christians, therefore, will find guidance in the example of Jesus' life and ministry which will assist them in achieving inner peace through being <strong>faithful to their calling</strong>, maintaining personal integrity and placing the needs of others before their own. These elements provide a sense of freedom and wellbeing and avoid the kind of inner turmoil and conflict which arises from selfishness and compromise. </p>

		</div>
		<h2>Prayer and Service</h2>
		<div class="content2">				  
          <div class="footnote"><p>Balance of prayer and active ministry</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The ministry of Jesus highlights the aspects of <strong>prayer and service being kept in balance</strong>. The gospel accounts portray Jesus as a <strong>man of prayer</strong> who is frequently in communion with God. These occasions of prayer are particularly evident leading up to significant moments in his ministry.</p>
			<p>Clearly prayer is a vehicle through which Jesus is able <strong>to nurture and sustain the relationship with God</strong> which is the source of his wellbeing and inner peace. This relationship of prayer is something which followers of Jesus are strongly encouraged to emulate in order achieve this sense of <strong>peace and serenity</strong>.</p>
			<p>For Jesus, prayer is <strong>not a withdrawal</strong> from the events of daily life but rather an opportunity to reflect on them and gain strength to face their challenges. Jesus' ministry conveys a sense of balance between <strong>prayer and contemplation</strong> on one hand and <strong>active service</strong> on the other. </p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Not in competition</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>These two elements are seen as <strong>complementary</strong>, not in competition with one another.  Prayer is seen as an essential adjunct to the active ministry while the ministry is seen as a practical expression of the life of prayer.</p>
			<p>Together the two elements of prayer and service provide important aids for Christians in the search for inner peace. Prayer enables the Christian to <strong>sustain and nurture</strong> their relationship with God. Through prayer they are able to draw meaning and understanding concerning day to day life as well as gaining strength and inspiration to enable them to meet daily challenges.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Service flows from prayer</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The active component of service flows out of the contemplative element of prayer. The understanding gained through prayer and reflection <strong>informs and guides</strong> the Christian to respond to the call to service. Additionally, the <strong>strength and inspiration</strong> they gain through prayer enables them to rise to the challenges they may face in serving others.</p>
			<p>Christians are encouraged to find a <strong>balance between the contemplative and the active elements of life</strong>. An overemphasis on prayer and contemplation can lead to <strong>insularity</strong> while an overemphasis on active service can lead to <strong>burn out</strong>. Either of these excesses will undermine the search for an inner peace.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>Community</h2>
		<div class="content2">		
          <div class="footnote"><p>Harmony in community</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Another characteristic of Jesus' ministry which is followed by Christians is the element of community.  The Christian community is an important source of <strong>help and support</strong> and the unity which can exist in such communities provides tremendous assistance in the search for inner peace.</p>
			<p>Jesus' own community was made up of those who followed him throughout the region of Galilee and then on into Jerusalem. His community of followers <strong>shared a great deal of his experience</strong>, learned from him and supported him in his ministry. Such elements of <strong>sharing, learning and supporting</strong> will assist individuals to find a harmony and sense of purpose in community which assists in the search for inner peace and wellbeing.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Absence or disintegration</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The importance of community in the achievement of inner peace can best be illustrated by the <strong>effects of its absence</strong> or the <strong>effects of its disintegration</strong>. The absence of community leads to isolation and separation. Because people are essentially social by nature, the absence of meaningful community will inevitably erode their sense of wellbeing and destroy their inner peace.</p>
			<p>Likewise, the breakdown or disintegration of a community through conflict, disunity etc will also have a negative effect on an individual's sense of wellbeing.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		<h2>Towards Inner Peace</h2>
		<div class="content2">			  
          <div class="footnote"><p>Prayer, service, ritual and community</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>For individuals to achieve inner peace, following the example of Jesus is a fruitful and worthwhile path. Various groups within the Christian tradition will have <strong>established methods</strong> of following this example. They will normally include the use of prayer, ritual and the reading of scripture, the service of others and the participation in community with those of similar beliefs. </p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Basic orientation</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Creating a basic orientation in life which supports the quest for integrity and fidelity to the gospel is an <strong>important foundational element</strong>. It will not be possible to achieve inner peace while values are seriously compromised.</p>
			<p>Maintaining a sound <strong>balance between prayer and service</strong> is also fundamental to the quest for a sense of peace and wellbeing. Both prayer and service are essential and each should support and draw from the other.</p>
			<p>Engaging with a <strong>local community</strong> is also an important element. Communities provide important occasions of interaction for sharing, for learning and for support. The absence of meaningful community undermines the possibility of achieving inner peace.</p>
