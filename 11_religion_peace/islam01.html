		<h1>Content Description</h1>
		<h2>The understanding of peace expressed in the Qur'an and Hadith</h2>
		<div class="content2">
          <div class="footnote"><p>Fundamental text</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>In Islam, the <strong>Qur'an is the fundamental text</strong> for all Muslims. It is believed to contain the revelation of Allah, <strong>complete and unaltered</strong> as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad beginning with the first revelation on the night of power and continuing over hundreds of occasions during the remainder of his life.</p>
			<p>The Qur'an is organised into 114 surahs or chapters. The order of the Qur'an today is not the same order in which the revelations were received. The order is according to an instruction given to the Prophet Muhammad later in his life.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Collection of traditions of Muhammad</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The term <strong>"hadith"</strong> means that which has been <strong>recounted or told</strong>. The hadith refers to the collection of traditions of the words and deeds of Muhammad. Many such traditions emerged after the death of Muhammad and these are highly respected though they are viewed separately and <strong>subordinate to the Qur'an</strong>.</p>
			<p>The religion of <strong>Islam is essentially one of peace</strong>. The word "Islam" itself comes from selm and salam the <strong>Arabic words for peace</strong>. Muslims greet one another with the expression "As-Salamu-Alaykum" which means <strong>peace be with you</strong>.</p>
			<p>From the very first verse of the Qur'an the theme of peace is evident. " In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most compassionate." This tone continues in many places throughout the revealed text. This verse is repeated in the Qur'an no less than 114 times.  It shows the great importance Islam attaches to such values as mercy and compassion. One of Allah's names, according to the Qur'an, is <strong>"As Salaam" which means peace</strong>.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Paths of peace</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The Qur'an refers to Islam as <strong>'the paths of peace'</strong> (5:16). It describes reconciliation as a basic stance (4:128) and states that Allah <strong>abhors disturbance of the peace</strong>. (2:205) Islam regards the mission of the Prophet Muhammad as one of <strong>peace and mercy</strong> to humankind. (21:107)</p>
			<p>A study of the Qur'an shows that much of it as well as the traditions of the hadith is based on peace and kindness, either directly or indirectly.  The ideal society, according to the Qur'an is "Dar al Salaam" which means the <strong>house of peace</strong>. (10:25)</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Natural order conveys peace</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The accounts of creation and the natural order in the Qur'an present the universe as a model, which is <strong>characterised by harmony and peace</strong> (36:40) When Allah created heaven and the earth it was ordered so that each element may perform its function peacefully without clashing with any other part. The Qur'an states that "the sun is not allowed to overtake the moon, nor does the night out pace the day. Each in its own orbit runs."  (36:40) </p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Essence of Islam</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>The very <strong>essence of Islam is peace</strong> and authentic Islam cannot be achieved except in an atmosphere of peace and harmony.  According to Islam peace is <strong>not simply an absence of war</strong>.  Peace opens doors of all kinds of opportunities, which are present in any given situation. It is only peaceful situation in which planned activities are possible. Due to this the Qur'an says 'reconciliation is the best'  (4:128) Similarly the tradition of the Prophet Muhammad affirms "Allah grants to ifq (gentleness) what he does not grant to unf (violence), (Hadith 4/255).</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>War of aggression not permitted</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>Because of this importance of peace the Qur'an has clearly declared that <strong>no aggressive war is permitted in Islam</strong>.  Muslims can engage themselves only in a defensive, not in an offensive war, whatever the circumstances. (2:190). According to Islam, <strong>peace is the rule and war is only an exception</strong>.</p>
			<p>Even in a situation of a defensive war Muslims are required to make an assessment of the situation and if the likely outcome does not warrant the conflict Muslims should avoid the war.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Jihad misrepresented</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>One of the most often misrepresented ideas in Islam is the notion if "jihad" or struggle. Jihad is a <strong>central teaching of Islam</strong> but is <strong>not</strong>, as many believe, <strong>synonymous for war</strong>. It is not even the term used in the Qur'an to refer to war When the Qur'an refers to war or fighting it uses the word "qital" and not jihad.</p>
			<p>Jihad literally means to <strong>strive or to struggle</strong>. In its proper usage it refers mostly to the essential struggle in <strong>overcoming obstacles to submission to Allah</strong>. It can, and does also refer to the military struggle to achieve religious freedom for Muslims and the protection of Muslim values, however, the use of force is always a last resort and war of aggression is never an option for Islam.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="footnote"><p>Muhammad's prayer</p></div>                            
		  <div class="text">
		    <p>According to the <strong>tradition of the Hadith</strong>, the daily prayer of the Prophet Muhammad was <strong>centered on peace</strong>. A peace which comes from Allah and a peace which is foundational to the faith of Islam: "O Allah, you are the original source of peace; from you is all peace, and to you returns all peace, So, make us live with Peace; and let us enter paradise; The House of Peace.  Blessed be you, our Lord, to whom belongs all Majesty and Honor!"</p>
